ua3gan,1650713624,Took tranexamic acid for a bleed for the first time,"Backstory: I have very mild VWB 1 and Thrombocytopenia. I was also diagnosed with hemophilia and then undiagnosed (bc of, imo, some bs reasons), but my factor 8 levels fluctuate every now and again. I was diagnosed pretty late in life (15), and my mother has never been the most approving of my vwb meds. TLDR: vwb, low platelets, unreliable factor 8, and no knowledge of how or when to take meds.\n\nI recently got into wood carving, which is a *wonderful* hobby for a person with a bleeding disorder. I can't tell you the number of times I've cut my fingers. I'm in uni and took this up as a project for a class, so its a little late to stop.\n\nAnyways I cut the hell out of my hand yesterday. Not that big but a little deeper then anyone would have liked. And boy did she bleed. I managed to make it stop after a while and threw a bandaid on it to be safe. I guess I moved my hand a little weird because next thing I know I'm bleeding just as bad again.\n\nI decided to take my tranexamic acid for the cut to see if it would help because I was a little concerned I would end up having to go to the hospital. I've never actually taken tranexamic acid for a bleed, I kinda just wait it out whenever I have one/when one reopens so I didn't know what to expect. My doctors suggested it once upon a time, but since I was a minor and my mom was always so dismissive and didn't really approve of it I didn't really take it for anything but my period.\n\nGood lord that was a life changing experience. \n\nI'm not bleeding anymore which holy shit. With a regular cut, even if I'm not constantly bleeding, most of my cuts reopen for the first three days a lot. Hasn't reopened since. Band-aid? Clean. I didn't realize folks didn't bleed for that long. I didn't realize *I* could stop bleeding that quick. I was not expecting to just, not have to worry about it as much as I had been.

Been on OCPs since 13 for bleeding through pads/tampons every two hours, bleeding during minor dental procedures (my wisdom teeth soaked the cotton many times), bleeding profusely after minor/semi-moderate injuries, and have had iron transfusions. Never tested for any coagulation problems or VWF/VWD, my small town chalked it up to “feminine problems and anemia from periods.” However, after another heavy episode where I bled a ridiculous amount from a small cut that I got shaving my legs in the shower, I decided that enough is enough and it may be worth pursuing. I showed the picture of the bleeding (soaked paper towels) and the wound to my new PCP the next day, who fast-tracked me to hematology. I go in on Friday (3/25/22). \n\nI’m wondering if anybody has any advice before going in or anything they wished they had known/asked their hematologist? Maybe what I should expect?

I've had two pelvic/renal ultrasounds and a CT scan for reasons unrelated as this and all showed a normal reproductive tract. Besides a low RBC count and high hemoglobin/hematocrit and some other random stuff, my CBCs have been pretty normal, and I don't have a Factor V mutation. I'm on birth control.

The intended benefit of any eugenic intervention is individual/private welfare (the child to be, or family), rather than the welfare of the state as a whole. Second, it is premised on individual liberty, the freedom of parents to choose according to their own values and conceptions of the good life. The state does not mandate contraception, sterilization, prenatal testing, abortion or any other form of eugenic intervention. \n\nI want to include a couple of individuals with different inheritable diseases in my paper and have compiled a brief set of questions that i would like to ask.

qcq9y0,1634818001,Recent Factor X deficiency diagnosis - mixed emotions and rant! (Long),"I feel like I need to rant and rave in a safe space, although my condition is very mild.\n\nSo at the grand old age of 25, after 10 years of complaining to my GP about heavy menstrual periods, excessive bruising and all sorts of health professionals telling me “oh, you’re a bleeder aren’t you!”, I finally have my diagnosis. \n\nEach test my GP performed PT and APPT have been prolonged, and I was referred to a Haemotology clinic last year. After about 40 blood tests in total and each appointment being rescheduled at least twice due to covid and other reasons, I had a  phone call from a registrar at my hospital. He said all my factor assays were fine, VW was low end of normal but fine and my PT/APPT were not significantly prolonged. He said he is just going to do one more coag blood test and then discharge me. He also said to me “you’re not even anaemic at the moment so I don’t think your bleeding is as bad as you think”. Told me that if he took a sample of women my age, 80% would have the symptoms I’m describing and in his own words, “it’s a known female thing”. \n\nWell, this left me reassured but kind of bummed out at the same time as I just wanted to know what was wrong. I have a lot of family history of heavy bleeding, including an uncle who passed away in his 20s from a spontaneous haemorrhagic stroke, so I wanted to be certain everything was fine. \n\nI had my further coag screen and had another telephone appointment last week. It was a different doctor, a locum consultant. He said they have finally narrowed down which factor was to blame - Factor X. He said it’s a very rare condition that he has little knowledge on, and he would have to refer me onto the specialist haemophilia centre. I was reassured that my levels are only that of a very mild deficiency (50%, normal ranges 77-131%), but significant nonetheless. I mentioned that at my last appointment I was told all factors were fine, and he said that was absolutely not the case. \n\nI now have very mixed feelings about this diagnosis. Yes, I’m happy it’s finally been recognised as an abnormality as opposed to multiple doctors over the years telling me there’s nothing wrong with me. Also, looking over my previous blood test results from a teen, my PT/APPT were prolonged there too and nobody thought to tell me. However, I’m harbouring this guilt that actually, the deficiency is only mild and I’m making a big deal of nothing. I’m having a bit of imposter syndrome about being referred to the centre. And quite honestly, I’m worried. \n\nDespite having no serious complications in previous surgeries/extractions/piercings/tattoos etc (except the whole, “wow you’re a bleeder!), I’m now having to really put things on hold. My work won’t allow me to have a flu vaccine in-house, I may have to delay potential upcoming knee surgery following injury, and I’m also having to put on hold my plans to start a family. \n\nI don’t even know if anyone has made it to the end, I think I just really needed a rant. My friends and family are great but most don’t know - although my immediate family are likely going to have to all be tested now too, especially as my kid sister has some bleeding tendencies too. My partner doesn’t know how to react, as I reassure him it’s mild and nothing to worry about, while hiding some panic myself. And I don’t want him to google stuff and worry. I’m also now scared I can’t give him a family he really wants. \n\nThank you for being a shoulder to cry on (or a forum to rant on!)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Hemophilia/comments/qcq9y0/recent_factor_x_deficiency_diagnosis_mixed/

I’ve been having major hemorrhaging since around January/February. I’ve tried nearly everything. I’ve been on testosterone for a year and a half and that did nothing. I’m on norethindrone. I’m on danazol. I’m on depo. I’ve tried Tranexamic acid. I’ve tried amicar. Nothing helps. I finally screamed loud enough for me to go on humate p and it wasn’t doing all that good because my np didn’t know what she was doing. I managed to be able to switch to the head of the hematology department and she’s fantastic. She ended up putting me on 5440RCO every other day and it was successful. It didn’t decrease my bleeding, it completely stopped it. 100%. For over a month. I have done no changes to any of my medications. I do not to things to make me bleed. I avoid COX-1 NSAIDs.

I want to tell you all a story — my story. it’s long, and it’s a lot, often times too much for me to handle, but there will never be enough words to explain that. so, here I go — it all began with HEMOPHILIA C. 4 years old, they told my parents I was 1/100,000. neither of them had the factor 11 deficiency, but I did. it was a rarity. as life went on, I started having more problems. around the age of ten, mental disprders started presenting. nobody could find out what the source of my pain was, and so, dismissed it as ANXIETY. from ten to thirteen, I was diagnosed with a handful of things. GENDER DYSPHORIA (FTM), DEPRESSION, OCD, and the most recent, BIPOLAR. I also have my share of PTSD from a recent s**cide attempt. anyways, as you can imagine, there were more things going on than that. a concussion at fifteen will change my life forever — I was taken to the ER to have an emergency MRI or internal bleeding, a precaution taken because of my bleeding disorder. thankfully, there was none. but, they found my golden glory — a CHIARI MALFORMATION. it was the cause of so many of these problems, an actual answer! it’s been back and forth between every specialist possible since, trying to uncover all of my bodies indescribable secrets. psychiatrist/therapist (diagnosed with previously mentioned disorders), neurosurgeon (had decompression surgery, and am preparing for another next month), cardiologist (diagnosed with IST), rheumatologist (diagnosed with AMPS, EDS), endocrinologist (diagnosed with HYPOTHYROIDISM), GI (diagnosed with GERD, IBS, lactose intolerance), and I believe that’s it (“that’s it” haha)! the past year has been experimental with medication. after my attempt, my health has finally been taken a but more seriously. I have a happy, healthy home and support system, and managed to convince my doctors to help me start a medication cleanse. these past few days with the freedom from a dozen pills a day has been the best I’ve felt since the incident. I’ve been walking more, feeling myself get stronger again after my breakdown. I’m having scar tissue from my EDS removed from the decompression site soon. my intrusive thoughts are dying out. the impulsions that almost killed me are under my control now. I’ll be starting testosterone after my 18th birthday. I’m finding the right medications that work for me. I have learned to love all of me, and am becoming the person I never thought I would, but always knew I was. things are getting better with time, even if it was a lot of it.

pc50v4,1630001212,Im hemophiliac and a police cadet,"I have mild type A hemophilia and I am in the process of being a police officer, in my country to be an officcer it is 4 years and I am in the 2nd, of course as a hemophiliac I have had health-related problems but I do not know why or how they have only been bruises or things related like that and it surprises me too much since we do a lot of exercise since in the process it is required and is also used as a sanction, I could say that every day we do exercises such as running, push-ups, advancing using the elbows and the tips of the feet and a long list for those who know those exercises typical of the military culture ... the most complicated thing in my process has undoubtedly been the external cuts, I still do not understand how nothing has ever happened to my knee, ankles, elbows since It is very common in hemophiliacs, only bruises in sectors near there, but in relation to the cuts I have had two that have been complicated, once while I was cutting a paper with my scissors for a job I cut my finger a little or with the scissors and literally I bleed for about 8 hours and I had to squeeze my finger with patches and super strong adhesive tape for up to 15 hours (obviously I slept with that kind of tourniquet) and I had taken pills with traxenic acid that I took as 10 and also put ground pills on my finger and the 2nd was quite similar but with the razors on one finger (due to bad handling) I was able to hide my wounds and bleeding ... so my post goes to the following. How is it possible that with all the exercise I do I have never damaged a joint?

pc4ij9,1629999699,anyone heard of changes in factor levels with age?,"So I'm in my early 30's, type a severe. When i was a teenager I could go for three days without factor before bleeding somewhere. If I hit four days I was pretty much guaranteed to have a bleed. Over the last year or two I haven't exactly been taking care of myself as well as I should be. I haven't taken factor in at least two and a half weeks now and haven't had any issues yet. I'm starting on Hemlibra very soon, and it just occurred to me that I might have a hard time noticing much difference now because of my seemingly increased baseline factor level. They were going to check my levels before I started Hemlibra, but that was before lock down, and I never had the tests run. Now it seems I don't need to have it checked. \n\nI have had synovectomies on most, not all, of my target joints since I was in my teens, so I'm sure that affects my bleed rate. But it seems as though I've stopped having spontaneous bleeds. I know I'm not growing any more, and my lifestyle is much more...sedentary now, all of which affects my bleed rate as well, but it still doesn't really make sense.

This was pre-VW-diagnosis and during a COVID surge in my area so I was hospitalized in the overcrowded hospital for 2 days because my hip was totally contracted and they couldn't figure out why, and the pain was so unbearable no amount of morphine was touching it. Finally they took a MRI and found the bleed, and immediately discharged me on bed rest with no treatment besides Tylenol for pain ""control"".\n\nThe hematoma from the bleed resolved after about 8 weeks (confirmed by MRI) and I've had physical therapy and follow up with a orthopedist but everything has been focused on exercising the injured muscle with basically zero improvement.\n\nI have really limited strength in my hip flexors on that side, 8 months later. We're talking, can't lift my leg to climb stairs level of weak.\n\nAlso, I have been getting increasing pain that feels like a ""crunch"" inside my hip joint with any type of weight bearing.\n\nBetween the weakness and the pain, I still can't walk reliably 8 months after the bleed, and I'm in moderate-severe pain 24/7.

I want to protect my joints, not to mention I don't want my muscles to wither away to nothing. I'm trying my best to do things that don't irritate my elbow too much, but I really can't put any load through the joint without a moderate amount of pain that lasts for days after exercising. And that goes doubly for actually actively moving my elbow while it's under load. \n\nFor me, things like bench press and free weight exercises that involve moving my elbow through it's range of motion are a no-go. I've been trying to do some shoulder, chest, and back stuff with free weights and machines where I basically hold my elbow in a static position while moving my shoulders, but even that causes some lingering pain.
