udndtx,1651122447,Struggling to get a preventative/daily inhaler instead of using my rescue almost daily,"I'm in a bit of a predicament here. I'm in my mid teens, and I've been diagnosed with cough variant asthma for twoish years. I was diagnosed after I had a strenuous battle with whooping cough and some of the blood tests revealed elevated markers for asthma. My parents and I never pursued any treatment because I didn't need it; as long as I didn't exercise and was cautious about not getting sick, I didn't experience many symptoms, at least, I thought I didn't.\n\nBut I've started realizing that my chest just always feels tight. It's not uncomfortable, but I just can't take a deep breath easily. When I inhale, it's like a slight resistance. I used to do my rescue inhaler, and that helped a ton, but then I realized it just.. never goes away unless I do the inhaler every 4-6 hours, which I don't think you're supposed to do with a rescue? If I am, then cool, but I still need something more manageable that doing an inhaler every 4-6 hours 24/7.\n\nI'm starting ROTC in the fall, and right now, without my inhaler, I can't run. It's not even a matter of stamina or endurance, it's literally like after 15 seconds of jogging, I'm wheezing and starting to get tingly in my fingers. My cap refill will be trash too. If I do my inhaler after that, it still takes a good hour or two until I'm back to normal ish. Now, if I do the inhaler fifteen minutes before working out, I'm better. Still takes me a long time to catch my breath, but as long as I do incremental runs, it's not too bad.\n\nBut with ROTC, I'll need to be running every day for long distances. I'm already planning on training over the summer, but I really need a preventative, daily inhaler so I don't keep needing to use my rescue. My brother took Pulmicort when he was younger, but his asthma was much more typical. I'm not necessarily looking for like, recommendations on treatments to try, but more just experiences maybe, or just support. I've wanted to be in the military since I was little, and if I can't manage my asthma reasonably there's no way I'll ever be able to join. I don't even really know all that triggers my asthma, apart from hot weather, exercise, dust/clay particles, and getting sick.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Asthma/comments/udndtx/struggling_to_get_a_preventativedaily_inhaler/

uctepi,1651027357,Need advice from the asthma experts! (New-ish asthma mom),"My four year old was “diagnosed” with asthma about a year and a half ago now. I know that they can’t officially be diagnosed that young but we had seen two different pulmonologists that both stated this to be their belief and who built treatment plans off it. We first got referred because of these weird recurrent “croup like” episodes that would land us in the urgent care or ER nonstop. She’s had chest X-rays, blood allergy testing, etc that all came back normal and the pulmonologists seem to think this is just run of the mill asthma. My question is… do any of you/your children/etc have this weird presentation as well? I guess in my head asthma seemed like the typical wheezing issues or kids who needed a rescue inhaler at soccer and so forth. We’ve tried oral steroids, albuterol, budesomide (sp?), and Flovent to no avail… This week we start Advair. Despite both pulmonologists agreeing this seems like asthma I just still struggle with feeling unconvinced… probably also due to the fact that we haven’t seemed to be able to dial in a solid treatment yet. I’m so frustrated that we’ve not been able to slow down or stop these episodes for her. There’s nothing worse (personally) than her being miserable and me not knowing how to help/not knowing if what we’re doing is actually helpful. We’re in the middle of another episode and I’m just laying here next to her while she sleeps… any advice, encouragement, whatever would be so appreciated.

I cant get his o2 above 92.  Is there something else I can be doing.  Or am I just being over freaked out about it?  Idk I just feel like I want to do something before its a full blown flare up again.  Any advise is appreciated.

ubtg5v,1650915463,Any climbers/mountaineers here?,"I've been a climber/mountaineer/backcountry skier for 5 years. I'm also an asthmatic with triggers including exercise and environmental (dogs, cats, etc.).\n\nI take 100mcg Zenhale twice daily and I have salbutamol for a rescue inhaler.\n\nSlow-paced sports I'm generally fine, which is why these activities seem to work. But I will generally have chest tightness during hiking/ski touring and use my rescue inhaler to relieve that. \n\nMy issue is, is that my asthma seems to be getting progressively worse despite being much more active than when I was a teenager. I was a competitive (but mediocre) swimmer but mainly just gamed. Maybe it feels worse because I'm noticing it from being more active but still, I'm trying to figure out the best way to get it under control. Regardless, it's always been 'mild'. I've never been hospitalized and barely ever had a full blown 'asthma attack'. It's just some tightness and wheezing. \n\nFor instance, I typically wake up with a tight chest. Take my zenhale and it may or may not be fully relieved. I'm currently sitting at work with a tight chest, having done literally nothing to cause it. It makes zero sense to me.  \n\nI'd like to get to a point where I am simply never using a rescue inhaler. I'm not sure if it's just too much environmental histamines causing it or something built up in my body. It seems like if I drink heavily or take edibles I will have extra tightness for a couple days. Maybe I need to simply avoid all triggers like that for awhile and do more cardio during the week. But I would be interested in hearing from other asthmatics (ideally people who are mountain athletes as well) on their experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Asthma/comments/ubtg5v/any_climbersmountaineers_here/

ubdeww,1650863509,What in the world is happening to me?,"I have been in and out of cardiology and pulmonology appointments trying to figure out what’s causing my shortness of breath. \n\nI have a significant amount of anxiety and daily panic attacks. I have been living with shortness of breath for about 10 years now and I’ve always assumed it to be anxiety. \n\nI was cleared by a cardiologist — everything is perfect. My pulmonologist did a lung function test which came back normal and I had no lung function improvement or changes with albuterol. After my appointment last week, I brushed it off as anxiety again. \n\nBut I cannot stop wheezing. I wheeze in the mornings. I’ve been wheezing all day. I feel like I cannot cough up whatever my lungs are filled with. I cough every single time I eat food, so it makes me not want to eat because I get so breathless. I’m afraid to workout. I have allergies, but I’ve never experienced breathing issues like this. I’ve noticed that drinking alcohol is the only thing that helps my symptoms, but obviously that’s not the answer. Plus, when I do drink, the day after causes symptoms that are 10x worse. \n\nMy insurance still hasn’t approved the inhaler I was prescribed, plus Albuterol caused a severe panic attack when I used it for my lung function test. \n\nI’m a 27yo female. I have Celiac disease, Hashimoto thyroid disorder, and mild seasonal allergies (or so I thought). I’m decently active and in shape. I’m doing the best I can to figure out what is going on. Is this anxiety? GERD? Asthma? If it’s asthma, does asthma just come completely out of nowhere? I’ve never wheezed in my life, until about 3 weeks ago. Do certain types of asthma have root causes? Is it worth it for me to try to see if a food allergy is causing it, etc? One pulmonologist said he thinks I’m fine. The other said I probably have asthma. \n\nI don’t know what asthma feels like. I don’t know what an asthma attack feels like. All I know is that I constantly feel short of breath, I cough after eating and in the mornings, my anxiety makes my symptoms worse, alcohol makes my symptoms go away, my blood oxygen is always 98-100, and my peak flow is always around 420/430.

I’ve tackled every possible variable as to why (started changing my sheets and dusting my room every couple days, tried sleeping with the windows both closed and opened, etc thinking it was dust related) but I’m thrown off because I get an asthma attack at night regardless of whether I’m in my own home, at my boyfriends house, in my car or outside. It also always goes away in my sleep and I wake up feeling fine. \n\n\nAs a kid I was originally diagnosed with primarily exercise induced asthma that only evolved past that after I got covid two years ago so the only thing I can think of is that the amount of movement that I do throughout the day is constantly building up and eventually causing me to have an asthma attack at the end of the day? Does that sound crazy?\n\n\nThis is kind of driving me crazy because I can’t take my inhaler at night since it makes my heart race and keeps me awake. Albuterol has always been my only method of treatment since my asthma wasn’t bad at all until covid and I just haven’t been to a doctor since way before then. Are there any treatments that won’t keep me awake like my inhaler does? I’m super unfamiliar with lots of asthma treatment options. As of right now I just take honey, Claritin just in case this is hay fever related, and melatonin to make me fall asleep despite my wheezing.

uayvy4,1650818987,at what point should I go to the hospital?,"I had untreated and undiagnosed asthma for over ten years. When I was finally diagnosed, my boyfriend said my asthma wasn't that bad since I had never been to the hospital during all those untreated years.\n\nI have silent asthma. I don't know if that is relevant.\n\nMy doctor actually told me that my asthma is moderately severe, and besides--during those untreated years, I spent so much time unable to breathe. I would be gasping for breath, unable to fill my lungs completely. My chest was tight pretty much 24/7. I spent hours and hours, often multiple times a day, just sitting in a hot shower because if I didn't, then I would be struggling severely to breathe in the summer months. The steam from the shower was the only thing that would help me. Even then, I just struggled to breathe in the shower until the asthma attack ended. Then I would be back in a few hours.\n\nThere were so many times that I literally thought I was going to die because I couldn't breathe. The only reason I never went to the hospital was because I couldn't afford it. When I was a teenager, my parents never took me, and when I grew up, I guess I just kept that mindset of not going to the hospital unless I was basically dragged there. I couldn't afford it as an adult either.\n\nAnyway, I guess I'm asking if my asthma isn't as severe as I think it is since I never went to the hospital?

u9grud,1650639877,asthma triggered by covid jabs???,"So I kind of think this cannot be true, and for nearly the last year my doctors have just been telling me when my peak flow dropped that it ""is my new normal"".   And I really don't want anyone to not get the jab because of this, but I want to know if people think my doctors are right or if I may be onto something. \n\nBut looking back, this time last year, my peak flow was around 440 - 450.   Then I had my first covid jab, to which I had a minor reaction.  Very nearly fainted about 30 minutes after wards, followed by an asthma attack, feeling like I had the flue for 3 days, and a half tennis ball sized lump in my arm that didn't go away for 10 days until I started taking some strong prescription antihistamines.   My peak flow dropped to 320 and only recovered slowly up to about 350-360 by the time of my second jab.   \n\nNot long after this I had also injured my achilles and wasn't able to run as much, so when I phoned the doctor my peak flow was just at my ""new normal""  even though the dip was on the night of the covid jab. \nI had some blood tests and nothing came out abnormal except that I have more red blood cells than is considered to be ""normal"" and they are all larger than is considered normal. I was told this is probably just normal for me and is nothing to worry about. \n\n\nMy second jab was similar. This time I was prescribed the antihistamines to start taking 2 days before the jab and to continue for a few days afterwards.  My reaction was pretty much identical to after the first one, except the swelling on my arm went down faster.   My peak flow dipped down to 220 and only recovered up to about 270 to 280. \n\n\nOver these months I also started getting other vague medical issues. I felt constantly tired. My rashes that are so far unexplained became more frequent.  I also gained weight which I put down to not running. I started getting out of breath on my daily walks which I also put down to me getting unfit as the doctors had told me it cannot be the covid jab. \n\n\nA while later I got my booster jab in December.  This time the doctor wouldn't prescribe the antihistamines in advance. He said wait to see how I reacted. This time the reaction was the same but the asthma attack was a little more severe.  The rash was also much worse, it covered most of my left side all the way into my foot. And took a couple of weeks to disappear. This time the doctor was just getting tired of my complaints and didn't seem to want to hear it. He didn't even want to see a photo of the rash (we have only phone call appointments unless the doctor requests one in person).  My peak flow died down to 180 and only recovered up to 240. Though its worth nothing that in the winter my peak flow is often about 30 less than my summer readings. \n\nAfter this I was really struggling. I was blaming myself for gaining weight and was really truing to push myself on my family walks and all my cycle rides.   I now couldn't eat a full meal without feeling completely breathless and feeling the need to make myself throw up some of it to be able to breathe again so I changed my eating habits to be snacking all day long as I couldn't fit in a full meal.  I also found that I was unable to bend down to tie my shoes at the same time as breathing. I struggled to lie down on the bed at the gp surgery when I was getting my ankle examined and when I got my cervical smeer done because they put the bed at a slight angle up which bent my torso. My torso must be straight for me to not feel breathless. \n\n\nOn Tuesday I had a slight sore throat and tested positive for covid. By the evening I had flu like symptoms. I felt the need to cough but I couldn't get enough force for coughing to do anything.   Wednesday evening I was debating calling 999, but I thought I'm not quite that bad. Thursday 830 am I called my gp and when she heard that I could barely get two words out without taking a gulp of breath she insisted I hang up and call 999.  I felt a little better than the night before so I was reluctant but I did. The paramedics arrived, gave me a nebulizer and sent me to the hospital.  At the hospital my peak flow was taken as 190, which was after some treatments. I was sent home that evening (last night) with another 5 days worth of steroids to take.   \n\nThis morning I woke up and for the first time in months, I can breath in without chest pain, and without it feeling like an effort!!  I can also cough! I have never been so happy to be able to actually cough even though it hurts my throat.   I took my peak flow and its already at 290!!! How is that even possible???  And I still have 4 days more steroids to take.   I also just feel overall so much better today.  Its the first day in months that I haven't needed a 3pm nap.   I can bend over to do stuff and not feel so out of breath.   \n\n\nSo I'm thinking that maybe my asthma has been getting worse over the past year and it wasn't just me becoming so utterly fat and unfit. I also hope that now I can start to lose the weight because I cam eat slightly larger portions so won't feel the need to snack and can make healthier choices. I feel like I will also be able to cycle and walk more. \n\n\nBut it just seems impossible, the doctors repeated told me that my peak flow was just my new normal. \n\nHas anyone else had a reaction to the covid jabs that caused their asthma to flair. \n\nOne weird thing of note is that in the hospital, although it was after the nebulizer, the doctor couldn't hear anything wrong with my lungs. I also usually haven't been wheezing. I've just been finding it very difficult to pull air into my lungs. \n\nI don't want to bring this up to the doctor for them to just laugh at me because it is due to my weight after all and I'm just being stupid. \n\n\nI'm female, 28, 5'2 or 158cm was 85kg a year ago and am now 96kg.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Asthma/comments/u9grud/asthma_triggered_by_covid_jabs/

My throat and lungs felt tight and grainy, I couldn’t take more than shallow breaths, was coughing but it didn’t help, and could barely talk.

I immediately retested and it would not post the scores until I restarted my phone and then I tested one last time and got 654 l/m and a fev1 of 85 percent which by that time was my 4th overall test.

u6t08p,1650331277,Asthma or anxiety?,"Hey everyone, 24F here. Had asthma as a child and into my teen years. Noticed that it didn't bother me as much as I got into my 20s. Regular (everyday) cannabis smoker as well for about 3 years. Started to wheeze one day pretty bad and the doc put me on 1 month of flovent and salbutamol as needed. Meanwhile, I stopped smoking and haven't smoked since. While on the flovent, I only used the salbutamol for the first couple days then didn't need it. Once my flovent treatment had completed, I started to feel a sharp pain in my tonsils and dry mouth after about a week. I couldn't sleep for about a week because of the sharp pain and dry mouth. I was constantly gagging and coughing. Then started to feel short of breath again but without wheezing. Went to the ER to get checked out, was told my dry mouth was due to asthma and was put on 5 days of prednisone (50mg/day) + another flovent inhaler + salbutamol as needed. Dry mouth/tonsil pain went away. I finished my 5 days of prednisone and am still doing the flovent inhaler everyday. I'm supposed to use it 2x/day, 2 inhales for 2 weeks then as needed. It's been a week and my shortness of breath hasn't gone away. Went to the ER again and everything seems normal. They did an x-ray and listened to my breathing and nothing. I also went to the doctor and they prescribed me some anti-depressants which I am hesitant on taking. I really don't want to be reliable on any medication that I don't need to and have decided to take up counselling to manage my anxiety. I'm worried that the dry mouth and tonsil pain will come back as I wean off of my flovent inhaler.

u6c3dr,1650285273,Is this asthma or something else?,"I am currently seeing a doctor about my breathing issues and have been trying a few different treatments. I was told to use my blue inhaler (ventolin) whenever I needed it. I was using it over 3 times a week, every week. My doctor then gave me a brown inhaler (steroidal) and told me to take it twice in the morning and then twice in the evening. I found that immediately after use I felt quite tight in the top of my chest. After 2 days I told told doctor and he prescribed a turbohaler which is kinda like a salt shaker. So far that's been alright but because I'm on holiday I haven't been able to compare this to my usual routines. Today tho I had a weird moment where I randomly felt breathless despite sitting down. I had to take 2 puffs of my blue inhaler where I only usually take 1 if I'm breathless before. Unless more of these episodes happen I'll be taking the turbohaler for at least until the end of summer\n\n\nI should mention that over the past few years my breathing capacity has gone downhill. Despite an increase in excersise I kept getting out of breath easier and easier over the years and in the first lockdown it went down significantly faster and then kinda....stopped... like it hit a barrier. \n\n\nI don't have episodes where suddenly I'm out of breath, at least never in the past. As soon as I wake up it's there, never really goes up or down in the day. I feel like stress is a big factor but I'm not sure.

u63as6,1650251366,Asthma and Post-Nasal Drip Symptoms For A While,"Hello, I am quite new to this sub and any sort of answers would be appreciated very much. This is a sort of a copy-past post I made on the askdocs sub but never seemed to get an answer at all so I might try my shot here. \n\n As the title says, I have been having this issue for quite some time now since April of 2020 precisely. I wanted to make this post to possibly get some insights about this issue I have been dealing with and some help from the doctors would truly help.\n\nAt this point, we were still in a lockdown I believe, and I had no reason to step out much really, and during this time I would Vape a lot constantly during the lockdown period. I continue this chain-smoking almost every day and hold in the smoke for 5-10 seconds. One day, I continued the same way of smoking, and immediately felt short of breath and then immediately stopped for about 1-2 weeks. During this time, I felt some back pain while I took the break and it was aching a lot like I had sprained it somehow but it eventually went away after that break. I then decide maybe I am good to smoke again, and then while inhaling it, the smoke kinda hurt my lungs when taking it in and there were days I would just smoke through it but not too much.\n\nThis eventually leads to suddenly me spitting out blood (without any cough). I could not tell where it was coming from whether it was from my lungs or my braces because, at the time, I did have braces on. I am panicking at this point, so I stop and decide to take another break should resolve the issue. I get back to smoking again, my lungs hurt, I still go through with it sometimes, then stop. The blood issue only seemed to get worse because there were days when I spat out a lot and I could not tell where it was coming from. I soon develop a cough that would go on for months.\n\nI finally decided to go to a doctor and this led to many tests like blood tests, chest X-rays, pulmonary function tests, covid tests, etc. My tests came out normal and I was given a steroid and albuterol inhaler. This helped my cough to be in control but it would come back again after a couple of days when I was done with the dosage (I used it every day). Now, this did help the cough to be in control but it also did not really resolve my shortness of breath issues and the pain in the lungs I would have at times. I was given the same medication again and the same thing would repeat again. I went again to my doctor for a physical and he did mention my cough could be due to a post-nasal drip but I did not really believe him until now.\n\nNow a couple of months ago, I start to realize where the bloody phlegm is starting to come from which is the back of my nose. This happens especially during the shower when there is hot vapor around and for that, I have started taking a steroid nasal spray and I think it's working. My cough has been gone for quite some time now on its own without any medication.\n\nToday, I am still suffering from most of these issues, and I am really frustrated and will be going to the doctor again soon. There are times when I feel like my lungs are wheezing, but there is no phlegm, sometimes when I laugh too I can hear and feel the vibration. When I run, my lungs hurt when I breathe in, and brings back the wheezing sounds when I exhale out through my mouth (this never happened before just for reference). The bloody phlegm happens at times but only in certain environments that come from the back of my nose.\n\nI apologize for this long and possibly confusing post, but I would like to hear what kinds of treatments I will be looking at to control these issues? Stronger steroid inhalers to control my lung issues? Is the steroid nasal spray good enough to treat with Post-Nasal Drip? I would like to hear from you.

This shit fucks with me so much mentally omg. Its frustrating and im constantly reminded every single day that my lungs are fucked and i know they are but then i see posts from other people and immediately put myself down bc my asthma may not be as sever as theirs is. And its great when i see others post their experiences (the experiences themselves aren't great but ya know talking ab them is, trusting people and what not). My asthma was very sever when i was younger to the point where my parents would take turns watching me sleep as a baby bc i would just stop breathing and my face was apparently almost always blue. I missed so much school the first couple years. It faded a bit, still there but more mild and then everything came crashing down in 2019 when i had an attack at volleyball practice so bad i turned blue and almost passed out. I didn't have any inhalers at the time bc my asthma was more mild so we all thought i finally outgrew it and got rid of everything pertaining to my asthma. Ig since it ""came back"" (basically just got *really* severe again) i haven't been 100% mentally. Maybe the stress of 2019 being the same year covid started and both of my grandparents on my dads side of the family died added up and the stress made my asthma worse. Since then it has gotten better though and even if that sounds like a lot it will never be enough for me. I will never stop thinking others have it worse and i will never admit to myself that i need help from anyone bc i have to much pride in myself and i *hate* that so much.

In December I had my first anaphylactic reaction (never had a severe food allergy before in my life, have had very basic seasonal allergies and asthma as a kid, but not extremely serious there either). My life completely changed, it took me weeks to recover and my throat and mouth have reacted to random foods/triggers ever since. The thing that’s changed recently has been spring allergies - this past week I noticed I was insanely tired and was experiencing throat tightness more at the middle and base of the throat (where the neck meets the top of the chest, if that makes sense). It would be especially strong after long walks outside and at night. I assumed it was allergies + asthma + heavy anxiety (last quarter in college), so I went to an urgent care and they gave me a new inhaler, told me my vitals and lungs looked/sounded fine. Fast forward to today, I did not take my allergy pills (I have papers to write and I get very tired on them) and felt great all day, then 11 pm hit and I was having noticeable/heavy tightness in that base/top of chest area, sort of shallow breathing, felt almost like a small panic attack. Took 2 puffs of the new inhaler and now at 1 am it’s nearly back to normal. I’m just a little confused, if this is a normal symptom or if this was a small asthma attack.

u3ss23,1649974236,Desperate for answers,"\nI (21M) had an inhalation injury in September (corrosive, perfluorinated chemical mixed with a fluorinated peroxide) and haven’t been able to get a full breath since then. I saw a pulmonologist who diagnosed me with reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (basically temporary asthma), but that seems to have improved. My FEV1 went from 85% to 97% over the course of three months, so no issues there. He said my lungs sounded great, and I’ve been off of the maintenance inhaler since February. That being said, I’m still having problems. \n\nI have constant, thick mucus in my throat with debris in it. I often get a feeling that my throat is closing off and I go into a panic where I feel like I’m fighting for my life. I’ve been to the ER twice because of these attacks, and they refuse to listen to me and just say it’s anxiety. I have never had any wheezing, but will occasionally cough maybe once or twice. My quality of life is not great, and I have a feeling of impending doom. More recently, I dream that I’m being choked and wake up hyperventilating and about to pass out. \n\nI don’t know if this is relevant, but I’ve also had some stomach issues since this started (doc said it might be due to prednisone), and sometimes I spit up small pieces of food with the mucus. I also get much, much more mucus after I run. Symptoms are worst when playing sports or driving. \n\nI try to stay positive and live my life, but it’s hard to concentrate on school when I feel like I won’t wake up the next morning. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone has had similar symptoms and was able to get answers. I don’t know if this is asthma, GERD, or something related. \n\nI’m sorry for the long read, and greatly appreciate any responses!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Asthma/comments/u3ss23/desperate_for_answers/

I was hospitalized for three days and sent home with prednisone to take for a week after.

However since moving into a mold ridden apartment I’ve been having 3-5 asthma attacks a day and waking up unable to breathe at night. I finally went to the doctor today and she prescribed me a 250/50 advair inhaler and a week of some other steroid medication. \n\nI’m wondering if anyone else has had luck with  advair after prednisone reactions, and if I should be worried.

First of all, i want to say, that my symptoms differ when i am outside and inside. Inside (especially my room) i have constant attacks, i have 24/7 phlegm in my back throat or airways (not sure) and sometimes, my lungs even hurt. My chest is heavy and i was also told, that while i am sleeping i am wheezing. I want to say, that our apartment is literally a wet dump - there is constant 70-75% humidity and you can even see wet spots on the ceiling (especially in my room). \n\nI was tested for allergies and i am allergic to dust mites, although i have been allergic to it my whole life and my asthma problems started only at age 21. I have tried to vacuum every day, wipe dust 2x per week, but it doesnt seem to help. I am on my 3rd maintance inhaler. Now i started Relvar Ellipta (Breo) - lowest dosage, i am on day 3-4, but it doesnt seem to help at all. Albuterol doesnt work for me at all it seems. \n\nThen i though, maybe its GERD? Sometimes i have burning sensation in my chest, more when i am drinking alcohol and especially, when i am stressed. So i recently bought ozepramole 20mg and i am on day 3, but again, i see no difference. \n\nWhen i am outside, my symptoms pretty much dissapear. I was cycling today and i had some phlegm, but waay lower and i wasnt coughing at all.

But humidity should be way lower.\n\nAlso, i dont know, if it can be connected, but i have problem with candida (oral thrush), but probably had it down there also and i didnt know about it?

u2vx0h,1649871757,Asthma meds increase my heart rate. Are there any out there that don't?,"**^(Notice: Yes I do plan on talking to my doctor. This is not asking for medical advice so much as it is asking for other people's personal accounts of their current medication regime. So I ask kindly that you move on if your only advice is ""Just talk to your doctor"".)** \n\nI'm 34F and take Montelukast (Singulair), and Symbicort. I only take the Symbicort two puffs once per evening per my doctor's instructions. This is to hopefully separate the number of hours between my Symbicort dose, and my ADHD medication dose. (*As it is a stimulant and also increases my resting heart rate*.)\n\n Currently, my RHR is around 78-84 if I am literally sleeping, and around 95-110 the rest of the day. If I forgot to take my Symbicort at night, and take it in the morning, it's about 110-125 for the majority of the day. If I forget to take it all together, I've noticed my RHR is about 85-95 during the day instead. I have also fought with heart palpitations for the past couple years as well. I have had an EKG done, and all was normal aside from the mild tachycardia.\n\nThings I've tried:\n\n\-I was taking Advair before, one puff once at night. Doc swapped me to Symbicort. No difference in palpitation episodes, or high RHR.\n\n\- I cut caffeine back to one cup of coffee in the morning and maybe a soda in the afternoon. Reduced heart palps, but not overall HR. Ironically, I have drank coffee and then watched it tank down to the 80's. ADHD body chemistry is fun, lol. \n\n\-I do try to walk briskly during my work breaks which amounts to about 30 minutes a day. I know I can probably start running or something, but I also know my medications are jacking up my HR artificially. Interestingly, when I work out and exercise with high intensity, my HR does not get above 175(max aerobic HR for my age).  It usually floats between 130-169 depending on intensity. Which I believe is in line for my age, and fitness level. It drops back to my normal shortly after finishing a work out. \n\n\- I also have been doing allergy shots for about 3 years. I am now at maintenance. It has helped exercise induced asthma reduce, but not my overall attacks. I am unsure if this is due to dependence on corticosteroids, or if my asthma has really not improved at all. If I miss a dose, you can guarantee I'm hitting my rescue inhaler.\n\nIs there anything out there I might try to see if it helps lower my HR? A different class of maintenance inhaler like Long acting beta antagonists only? Or, corticosteroid only? (as opposed to a combo drug like what I'm on) Or, should I just start running (not a fan) and see if I can lower it that way?  Eliminate the Montelukast? Try a beta blocker along side it? (If I do beta blockers I can no longer continue my allergy shots). Eliminating the ADHD stimulant would honestly be a dead last resort for me. I'd rather be functional and wheezy, then nonfunctional and non wheezy. \n\n**TL/DR**: Yes I plan on talking to my doctor. If anyone had their asthma meds increasing your HR, how did you handle it? And if you switched or eliminated meds, what did you use/do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Asthma/comments/u2vx0h/asthma_meds_increase_my_heart_rate_are_there_any/

u2aabi,1649799846,Why do my airways close when I smell food?,"So I’ve had this frequently happen for years. I’d like to know if this is common and linked to asthma, so if anyone can help I’d greatly appreciate it. :) Starting off with the first time I took notice of this symptom, I was in high school. I remember on a school day during passing period, I was making my way towards the double doors that lead to the school’s interior hallways, and as soon as I neared the doors a body of students exited the doors I was hit with the gush of the wind that exited out of the hallways, I felt my air ways tighten and was instantly out of breath for some seconds as I made it past the students as the wind traveled away from me. I didn’t think much of it back then and later realized I had developed a defense towards this. Some days after I headed towards the same double doors and caught myself holding my breath in for 4 seconds before I opened it, making it through the body of students I let out a long breath of air that I didn’t know I was holding in. I was hit with confusion, why was I doing that? It’s not like there was a scent of disgust, I then started being more conscious of my behavior and realized I’ve been doing that for a while now and that my body and mind would automatically do this to prevent my lungs from tightening. As this defense seemed to work I continued to do that and it became a regular habit I soon had forgotten about. Until recently that is. along with other instances, yesterday, I had been analyzing my triggers and they seem to range from a wide variety. And this is where it really started to worry me because not only Perfumes but even food! Even my favorite foods that I consumed so much tighten my lungs! I’ve had hot Cheetos, home made foods, meat, yogurt, basically anything. As soon as I take a Whiff of the freshly opened package I can’t breath for a second. But seconds after the sensation is gone and I can consume it normally. And it’s very irregular, so even if i had a bad reaction the first time the second or third I’d be completely fine. So it’s not an allergic reaction. I appreciate any input of what it might be! Thanks again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Asthma/comments/u2aabi/why_do_my_airways_close_when_i_smell_food/

I was finally able to see a doctor this year, so I did it. They diagnosed me with moderately severe asthma. I use a preventative inhaler twice a day, plus my rescue inhaler when I feel symptoms starting.\n\nI walk my dog every day and I end up using my rescue inhaler probably 5 days every week because of walking my dog. I have silent asthma so I don't usually feel the wheezing; I just have shortness of breath and my chest gets very tight. If I don't quickly use my inhaler, it often turns into a serious asthma attack that leaves me gasping for breath and unable to talk. I didn't get my rescue inhaler until about two weeks ago, so I've only had it for that long. The doctors didn't give me one until I ended up in the emergency room because of an attack.\n\nIs it normal to need my rescue inhaler this often? I've read that I shouldn't need my inhaler more than twice a week, but I definitely need mine at least 4-5 times a week. I have asthma attacks when it's too hot outside, when I walk my dog, when there's pollen in the air, etc. Basically anything you can think of that might cause an attack, I have an attack.\n\nI live in a country where I don't speak the native language so my boyfriend has been doing all the translating at the hospitals for me.

I’m tired of going from doctor to doctor and wasting money. I can’t pinpoint what’s wrong with me. \n\nShort back story. 2 years ago, I Started with a sore throat and an extreme shortness of breath. I’m an athlete and for job related stress or cool downs I do a deep breathing technique. Well, one day my “deep breathing” got cut in half. I felt I could only breathe halfway as deep as I used to. I could not exercise anymore. I end up getting what I would call small asthma attacks, I would barely be able to catch my breath. Inhaling was short and exhaling was weak. Thought I was sick with a respiratory infection so went to a doctor. He said my throat was red and gave me antibiotics and an inhaler for exercise induced asthma. \n\nWent to an ENT because my sore throat never went away. He said my voice box was irritated and I have LPR and prescribed me PPI, omeprazole. It did nothing to my breathing albeit it did lessen some symptoms of heartburn. Follow up he said throat is less red but still red go to a gastro or pulmonologist since my breathing did not improve. \n\nWent to a pulmonologist who said I have allergies to animals, and adult onset asthma. He prescribed me montelukast, advair and pantoprazole., another PPI. I was effectively cured from this combo. On follow up he said I’m fine, left me with a year prescription of montelukast and nothing else.

I thought for sure i was just an awful singer, but I had one miracle day a couple weeks ago where all that disappeared, all my training came together in a beautiful way and voice was clear, consistent, accurate, and singing felt 1000% plain easier to do. It took me a few days to realize i was out of my flovent inhaler and waiting on a refill so i was off of it for a few days and i was simultaneously having a hard time breathing. I read an article online about a woman who was a professional singer with asthma who experienced the exact same thing! Fluticasone/inhaled corticosteroids causing vocal dryness. So I've been experimenting and sure enough i take my flovent as prescribed for a few days, don't take it for two and the correlation is there,  i cannot sing while taking flovent. I'm curious if anyone has suggestions for alternatives I'm seeing my doctor to reasses my medication tomorrow and some insight might help me on which medication to recommend or be open to. I should mention I was and am taking montelukast nightly which doesn't seem to help all that much.

It is definitely not managed though in any way. Read the bold stuff I guess if u don't wanna read all this.\n\nGuys I am only 21 and feel like I have the health issues of a 90 year old (not even just asthma I have tinnitus also, that's a relatively new one). I can barely go to school, holding down a job would be impossible right now because I am so sick 24/7. And dealing with this when I recently had a bf was so stressful (it was so fun when I had to take my albuterol 4 times in the car while he was driving me home:) ). I think I was/am too sick to date honestly. My life feels like it's over. I have never been so sick in my life than these past 2/3 years. It started when I was 19 and in August I'll be 22. I can't lead a normal life. I can't go out and have fun with my friends, and parties are basically out of the question. I have to be close to my nebulizer at all times, but I did find a way to transport it in my car so I can have it when I'm at school. Only a few weeks of school left and I have zero clue how I'm gonna make it. The anxiety of being alone at school with severe asthma all the time shoots my anxiety up. I can not sit through a single class without feeling like I am going to die. \n\nAnyways, I see a pulmologist and he is a very well known and good one around here. He was able to help my dad, but so far not me. So, I have a list below of symptoms to see if maybe something else is going on here and things I am doing to help this situation as best as I can. What am I missing? \n\n*  **Shortness of breath 24/7. Also wheezing,** but not 24/7.\n* **Trouble swallowing.** This started a little before my asthma got really bad. For the first year I barely ate any food and it gets worse when I'm with people. Anxiety probably plays a role here. I avoid restaurants like the plague. And when I do go to them I can barely eat (my ex noticed how little I ate when we went out). And when this stared I went to a throat doc and did a barium swallow and he was going to do an endoscopy but he said I was fine and did no need it. He did not see signs of GERD.\n*  **Throat tightness.** Started around the same time my asthma got bad. So like 2 years ago. I go through hours of feeling like my throat is closing but it never does.  Also, I get anxious after my allergy shots because I fear anaphylactic shock even though I have never gotten that and most (not all) times after I get the shots I feel the throat tightness. But I also get this feeling at random times and I also remember this tightness started BEFORE I got allergy shots. \n* **My pulse oximeter reading is always in the high 90’s**. If I was having bad asthma attacks wouldn’t it ever drop? Every time I have gone to the ER for asthma it also has never dropped.\n*  I have been on **Symbicort for a little over 2 months now and it does not seem to be helping** besides keeping wheezing at bay but within the last week I have had 2 wheezing instances when I haven’t had that since I started Symbicort.  \n* **Albuterol and nebulizer treatments sometimes do not work.** Honestly it is very rare where I take a rescue inhaler or nebulizer treatment and I actually notice a difference. But I still take them because breathing is so hard and I am afraid of dying. \n*  **I had a pulmonology function test** and a certain number, I think it was a number related to inflammation, was one of if not the highest number they have ever seen. So I do indeed have asthma. \n* **I went to the ER a couple weeks ago** for this crazy chest tightness and after a bunch of tests they said my lungs looked fine and it didn't seem like an asthma attack at all. Or the little bit of nebulizer I took before I got there might have taken a while to kick in. \n* Been on **allergy shots** for over a year now. \n\nI AM VERY SORRY FOR THE SUPER LONG POST--- I'm desperate here, had to get it all out",https://www.reddit.com/r/Asthma/comments/u0xphk/what_else_can_i_do21_and_life_feels_over/

How is the effectiveness and how are you taking it?\n\nDetails:\n\nI'm an ultrarunner and my EIB begins to show itself several hours into long races in the form of a tight chest, inability to take a full breath without coughing and if I slow down or stop the symptoms get much worse (like in an aid station or after the race).\n\nI had childhood asthma that went away in college.  When I began running ultras in my late 30s it took a few races before I recognized this might be asthma related.  I was confused because there was never any wheezing, like when I was a kid.  But there was the tight chest feeling, which I used to get as a kid after being in a pool for a long time.\n\nMy doctor originally started me out with Singular before my long runs and albuterol as needed.  It was hard to test because I don't do 6+ hour races every weekend (more like twice a year) and it took 6+ hours to even develop the symptoms.  But when I started taking Singulair before my long runs I noticed I could breathe easier from the very beginning. But in longer races I was still getting the bad symptoms and the albuterol did not seem to help (and it was hard to take when I was short of breath).\n\nSo I went back to the doctor and I was prescribed Symbicort as part of a new protocol for treating EIB.  I was prescribed 2 puffs every 6 hours while exercising.  Not sure where the albuterol fits in now but I will also keep taking the Singulair before long runs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Asthma/comments/u0en49/symbicort_and_eib/
