u8y8br,1650576938,Planning around surgery,"Hello,\n \nMy wife and I recently found out during our 20 week anatomy scan and subsequent fetal echo that our daughter will be born with d-Transposition of the Great Arteries.  We were told by our cardiologist at home that the surgery she will need should take place in the first few weeks of life, preferably in the first few days if she is stable enough.  We are grateful to live in the New England area of the USA and will fortunate enough to have her surgery at Boston Children’s Hospital.\n \nWe haven’t had our consultation with the surgeons or staff in Boston yet, and we are hoping to get an introduction to the social work / case managers there, as I have heard these people are a wonderful resource.  I was looking for insight from this community as to how other families managed the travel and housing in the time surrounding delivery and surgery, and how families have managed this period of time with a toddler in the mix (our first daughter just turned 2).\n \nI know it’s still far away so there is time to plan, but it feels that all of a sudden that we are surrounded by uncertainty and any info from those who have been through this would help.\n \nThanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/u8y8br/planning_around_surgery/
u7quau,1650439314,Weening off NG feeding,"So my daughter is 10 months old, but 7 months and 3 weeks corrected. She was born with double outlet right ventricle with VSD and pulmonary atresia. She's had two stent procedures and recently open heart surgery in February. \n\nSince the OHS, I've been weening her off the NG. Before the operation, I religiously fed her every 4 hours due to her being 1.3 KG born &amp; to gain weight for her OHS so there was no method of responsive feeding ever until now. She sleeps through the night from 9pm until 7.30am, and then has a feed when she wakes, and 4 hourly afterwards of between 120mls to 180mls of SMA from birth formula but usually drinks most of the bottle. Also has 3 meals of solids a day as well as snacks. \n\nShe's been doing brilliantly for a baby who couldn't even handle 20-30 MLS of bottle without getting tired, and from a week after her OHS, had her first full bottle for the first time since September. Only issue I'm having, is that her morning feed is EXTREMELY hard to get her to take orally, which I find strange because she'd have gone her entire sleep without a feed. I've said this to the doctors already but they said go with her ques. But if I did, it would take her almost 2-3 hours after waking up to have a feed which messes up the routine then and she won't get her basic amount in, in a day. \n\nShe ripped out her tube last Thursday and I said is give it a chance, and she's been doing brilliantly. It's just this morning feed I'm having the most stress with. \n\nHope this all makes sense but just wondering if anyone has any advice on what to do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/u7quau/weening_off_ng_feeding/

From what my ACHD cardiologist says, the surgery was very successful. Most doctors have a hard time hearing my heart murmur now. I've always seen a cardiologist every 1-2 years, and I was just seen recently and told my heart is in good condition and I don't need to be seen for 3 years. \n\nSo, I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed 10mg adderall XR, and have been taking that for a month. I'm now increasing to 20mg. The adderall is definitely helping my ADHD symptoms which is awesome, but after\nsome reading I'm a little concerned about my heart. I initially told my psychiatrist I have a heart murmur and had a procedure when I was a kid, but that I just saw my cardiologist who said my heart looked great. My psychiatrist didn't seem concerned at all. \n\nDoes anyone here have ADHD and takes adderall or another stimulant? Wondering if anyone has had this convo with their cardiologist already. I know everyone’s heart and situation is different, but was wondering if there is general guidance on CHD and ADHD medications. I plan to follow up and just ask my cardiologist what he thinks.\nBut in the mean time I was trying to get some info.

Everything seemed normal, nuchal translucency was ok and the baby was moving throughout the scan. At the end of the scan the tech stepped out to communicate with the MD who was reading the scans remotely. When she came back in the room she told us we would have to have a repeat scan in two weeks, but was not authorized to tell us why or what exactly was the concern. We were told to contact the doctor who read the scan when we asked what to do next at checkout. He eventually called us and told us that there was cardiac axis deviation to the left and that we needed to follow up in person in two weeks. I didn’t know to ask any follow up questions. After reading about this finding it seems likely that it is indicative of CHD. I should mention that genetic testing had no abnormal findings. I was wondering if any other parents have experienced this at such an early gestational age? I would also appreciate suggestions on what questions to ask at the next appointment. \n\nP.S.

terozn,1647358430,9 week old son with 7 mm VSD,"Hello Everyone!\n\nMy 9 week old son (born at 37+1 weeks) was diagnosed with a VSD during an echocardiogram at 23 weeks gestation. We were originally told it’s in a “good spot” and very small — likely to close itself. After the 33 week gestation echocardiogram the cardiologist confirmed the VSD is still there and in fact it grew in size. My baby had another echo at the hospital, a day after he was born, but we were released home and scheduled for another echo at 3 weeks old. He was seen by three different pediatricians before he turned 2 weeks old and none of them heard any murmur. During his 3-weeks-old cardio appointment we found out that the VSD size is 7mm and it’s rather unlikely to close itself. The cardiologist explained that the murmur wasn’t there because of the high pressure in his lungs. For now we were instructed to monitor his condition at home and follow up in early April. We had a pediatrician appointment end of Feb and the doctor said that now he can hear the murmur well. He also said that the baby gained very little weight considering his growth in height. We were not then concerned because my husband and I are both tall and lean (I’m 5’7” and the most I’ve ever weighted was 136 lbs at 9 months pregnant, pre-pregnancy I was at 97 lbs and I’ve been “ultra skinny” my entire life). The doctor took genetics of my husband and I into consideration and decided not to be worried about his weight just yet. \n\nHowever, within the last week I have noticed my son drastically slowed down in terms of how often and how much he eats. He’d go 2:30-3h between feedings and finish a 3-4 oz bottle within 20-30 min. Now, he goes 2-2:30 h between feedings but he struggles to finish even just 2 oz in an hour. I can tell he is hungry and wants to eat but his heart starts pounding and he’s breathing extra hard and wheezing. I also noticed he is not interested in tummy time anymore. He sort of just lays there like a log without the energy to lift his head up. \n\nWith all that being said, does it sound like we’re heading towards surgery or is there any chance the hole could be closing itself (and maybe that is why the pediatrician heard the murmur now)? I would really appreciate any comment from parents whose babies had to undergo the surgery and those whose babies VSD resolved on their own. I am losing my mind, I can’t eat or sleep. Every time I look at him I start crying and can’t control it. All I see and think about is the hole in his heart. I went on an antidepressant and anti anxiety medication and it’s doing nothing so far. I would really appreciate some tips on how to deal with this. \n\nThank you in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/terozn/9_week_old_son_with_7_mm_vsd/

t8cq6x,1646613221,Baby with critical CHD and intrauterine growth restriction - any experiences?,"Hi folks. First, I want to say how much this sub has given me hope for my kid's future. It's been so reassuring to see posts from adults living well with CHD.\n\nI'm currently 32 weeks pregnant. My husband and I found out that our baby has a heart defect at our 20-week anatomy scan. After several weeks of appointments with MFMs and pediatric cardiology we got the full diagnosis, which is tricuspid atresia with hypoplastic right ventricle and a large ventricular septal defect. We're told the VSD is a good thing because it has allowed decent blood flow through the pulmonary artery, and baby's pulmonary artery and branches look healthy.\n\nRight now the initial plan (which I understand is pretty standard) is surgery for pulmonary artery banding in the first few weeks after he's born, followed by Glenn at 4-6 months, and Fontan at 2-4 years. But we have another complicating factor, which is that our baby is also experiencing intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). He's measuring quite small right now - below the first percentile. We're having twice weekly non-stress tests and growth scans every two weeks. He seems to be doing ok for the time being and is growing between scans, but is slowly falling off the growth curve. We'll may need an induction sometime between 34 and 37 weeks if he totally stops growing or there is evidence of distress or placental insufficiency. That isn't super early, but is obviously much less ideal for a baby who needs heart surgery than being born full time.\n\nAnyway, the TLDR is that I've read a lot about IUGR, and read a lot about critical/single ventricle CHDs, but not a lot about both. Has anyone had both of these with their child and had things work ok? We felt hopeful about the heart prognosis but it's been really difficult not to feel overwhelmed by having two diagnoses that seem to complicate each other.\n\nTIA!",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/t8cq6x/baby_with_critical_chd_and_intrauterine_growth/

It’s been getting some traction because it got into a prestigious film festival called Slamdance, which starts next week!   \nThe film, Broken Hearts, follows Indigo Johnson, a teenager with congenital heart disease (CHD) who wants nothing more than to get her ears pierced, but she's never been allowed to due to medical forewarnings of endocarditis (a life threatening heart infection). It doesn’t help that her New-Age crazed parents are overprotective and govern her life based on astrological forecasts. At a cardiologist appointment in prep for an upcoming surgery, she meets Sarah – a younger, eccentric, and vivacious CHD survivor getting a heart transplant in only a few days. The two decide to break out of the hospital together to go on an adventure and feel like normal rebellious teenagers for a day, and maybe get some piercings while they’re at it. \n\nHere’s a trailer for it:  \n[https://vimeo.com/582331072](https://vimeo.com/582331072)   \nIf any of you have Instagram, please follow the IG page, it will help promote the film a lot and help get more CHD awareness! :)  \n@brokenheartsthefilm   \n[https://www.instagram.com/brokenheartsthefilm/](https://www.instagram.com/brokenheartsthefilm/)\n\nAnd just in general please help spread the word about the film and share the trailer!  \nAfter the film has completed its festival run I can share the full film publicly.   \nHope you like!",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/sa7age/cute_film_about_chd_and_piercings/

rupmvv,1641174415,Question about my life expectancy (d-TGA),"Hi everyone, I have d-TGA. It's not a problem right now but I'm only 19 and I'm really worried about my future and have been for a while. My cardiologist never tells me anything terribly useful about this. I had an arterial switch operation and for about a year now have an irregular heart beat. There is sometimes and extra beat. I have no restrictions on physical activity but my cardiologist said it might be time to monitor things more closely than I have been. I wore a Holter monitor for a day a while back which diagnosed the heart beat. I don't take anything for the heart beat so it's probably currently not too huge of a deal. I'm going to have an MRI with contrast in three days which I'm freaking out about because I hate needles and have bad health anxiety but I know I'm being dramatic and it's basically nothing and won't hurt.\n\nAnyway I guess I'm saying all this to show that everything seems to be normal so far. I certainly have no symptoms and have only had the one surgery. My chest looks kind of weird and deformed. So do my ribs. I sent a picture to my cardiologist and he said it was probably just how my bones developed but I'm going to see someone for it anyway since he only saw a picture.\n\nOk I'm done rambling now. I would just like to know if anyone can tell me anything about my life expectancy and if future surgeries are likely. Can I expect to live a normal length life? I think the oldest person with an arterial switch is 46 currently. The procedure itself is only 46 years old so if that information is correct than that means that some of the first patients are still alive. I'm not positive that that is correct but I remember my cardiologist making that claim months ago.\n\nSo does anyone with my condition have any insight to offer? I'm sorry, I know I'm being dramatic and ungrateful and that I have it really good. It's just that I know those things can change instantly and I can't stop worrying.

I can’t seem to take my adhd meds, drink caffeine, or take any medication without the thought of my heart stopping or getting a heart attack.

I still have to go to my pediatric cardiologist because of how rare they say my condition is. I just bought a house last year, I have a decent job, a small business I run on the side, and my partner who lives with me. I even save money for retirement at work, but I know I won't reach the age of retirement I sometimes think I should just take the money I have and go enjoy what life I have left. It's just hard not knowing when your time comes and I know that's the same for everyone, but at the same time I feel it's different for us because ""normal"" people have a lot better chance of dying at an average age.",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/rc4buo/need_to_open_up/
rb6bm4,1638903002,Resting heart rate question update,"So I was asked to keep you guys updated so here goes.\n\nYesterday I called all the Cardiology clinics that are close to me.  All required a referral.  I made a walk in appointment with my primary care provider.  On the drive over, I started feeling dizzy.  I thought it was just a panic attack because I had been anxious about everything.  I finally made it to the office and I sat and waited.  I felt so tired I didn't even look at my phone.  When they called me back I barely made it to the room after stepping off the scales.  Once I sat down in the chair I started breathing heavy and felt like I was going to pass out.  The nurse was like...""Slow down your breathing, you are going to hyperventilate!"" Like I was faking or overreacting or something.  She came over and tried to take a BP but couldn't get anything.  She called in another nurse who also couldn't get anything.  They called in a THIRD nurse who said he really didn't hear anything.  When my doctor came in he said my BP was 80 palp.  He sent me by ambulance to a hospital as my heart rate was 122 when I came in.  In the ambulance I heard the lady tell the ER that my BP was 50/35 in Semi Fowlers(!).\n\nI have to say the hospital was very thorough.  Long story short, I normally take Metoprolol succinate so they gave me Metoprolol Tartrate and that did seem to help.  My resting heart rate is still sitting at around 113.  They did give me a Philips DigiTrak XT monitor for 48 hours at the ER so I feel safer with that.   I haven't left the house to see if I can really walk any distance but my son wants to go to the Commissary this afternoon so I think I will see how that goes (with him driving, of course). I called my Cardiologist's office and they said they will get the records.  Not sure what good that will do but all I can say is I have tried.  I have gone to the ER twice, been to my Primary doctor and called my Cardiologist three times, so if I drop dead tomorrow nobody can say I haven't tried to get help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/rb6bm4/resting_heart_rate_question_update/

Thursday I was taking my 10 pound cat to the vet and putting the cat in the car triggered my rate to go to over 200. It has happened before and I usually call the ambulance but by the time I get there,  I'm back to normal. This time is different. It's 4 days later and I'm still with a resting heart rate of about 105. It's driving me crazy. I had to take melatonin to sleep last night because the heart pounding sensation is keeping me up. I did end up going to the ER that night and was given 10 MG IV Labetolol and told to follow up with my cardiologist. I called Friday and they told me to go up to 25 MG on my metoprolol (I was taking 12.5) . The Labetolol didn't help, the increased dose of Metoprolol hasn't helped. They are sending me a Holter but I guess a resting heart rate of 100 is nothing to worry about? Am I being paranoid?

payjvz,1629846244,Thoughts About the Vaccine,"Hello everyone, I am a male adolescent with HLHS. I've been wondering recently if I should get vaccinated, seeing as how the Pfizer shot was just FDA approved and Delta has gotten worse than ever.\n\nI am *not* and *will never be* anti-vax by any means, and if it's anything I want, it's to not end up in the hospital with severe Covid. (trust me, I'm terrified of it)\n\nHowever, I've been very concerned about the possibility of myo/pericarditis from the Pfizer/Moderna shots, and what would happen if I were to get either of them (the inflammation, not the vax). It doesn't help that I'm already within the group that is most likely to get it (adolescent males), and as a CHD patient, if I get it it would definitely spell out trouble. I truly believe in the positive impact that science and medicine has had on our society, but every time I hear a story titled like ""Teen dies from vaccine"" or ""this person suffered permanent damage from the covid shot"" it almost makes me feel like I would be playing russian roulette with myself if I were to get it.\n\nI'm starting my senior year of high school virtually for this reason (my district is no longer doing distance learning), though I know that I'll eventually have to start doing things physically again at some point.\n\nI've talked to my cardiologist about this, and they confirm that inflammation of the heart is something they do not want me to get. I've also wondered if I should try getting the J &amp; J shot instead (though that has its own host of possible side effects), but overall I know that the longer I go without doing anything, the worse things will most likely get for me and my family.\n\nAny thoughts or advice on this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/payjvz/thoughts_about_the_vaccine/

Im scared to really leave my house, because of covid, and I am afraid ill feel sick and ruin plans or ill end up in the ER.  A good chunk of me is upset with my biological mother. She was on a lot of drugs and alcohol when she gave birth. I feel because of her stupid choices this heart condition took a lot from me. Im trying to be better and do the best I can. As a kid it wasn't as bad, but once in my late mid 20s, I started  feeling my body change. I hate every right now. I know it'll pass but, man anxiety is the damn devil.

Like once i focus on my [already fast] heartbeat, it just makes it beat faster because I’m scared something is going wrong with my heart.

I had my PVR via OHS almost a year an a half ago.  It took me a long time, years of studies and tests to figure out that I needed a valve.  I felt so much better after my surgery...I could run!! I could work out hard.  But lately, this year in fact, I can barely even walk fast without rhythm disturbances.  I forgot something in Target Friday and jogged across the store so as to not hold up the cashier.  I was fine at checkout but as I was walking to my car my heart started racing.  I was alone and couldn't get it to come back down so I called an ambulance.  My HR was 210 when the fire truck got there. It was going from 200s to 130 to 170, all over the place.  When I got to the hospital it would go up when I would transfer from the stretcher to the hospital bed.  Of course by the time the doctor actually saw me and I was hooked up to the monitors I was fine.  NOT that I want anything to be wrong but I just feel crazy sometimes.  There have been multiple other instances, that one was just the most recent and lasted the longest.  Just now I walked a little fast to give my neighbor a letter that was in my box and I came in and had to stand still because of palpitations.

It's just too hard and too much.  I don't know what could be causing this and I feel like if I go up there they will say well it's not dangerous, just live with it.  The last time it happened I had a Holter and my doctor read it and told me no changes.  Not to come in or anything.  The problem is, he's the only congenital heart doc in my state.

He said he'd probably never get vaccinated because his parents ""don't believe in it.""\n\nThe last thing I want to do is keep my kids under glass, but our cardiologist was emphatic that we must take every precaution against the disease for our youngest. Staying as isolated as we have been for the last 16 months was a very easy choice to make, but a very difficult one to live with. It's made me a depressed, tired arbiter of disappointment. No we can't do this, no we can't do that.

obvznt,1625175789,Sudden PVCs with corrected ASD,"I was operated on at 6 months old to correct ASD. From the information I have from my mom there were also some valve issues that needed to be taken care of, but I do not have specifics. I do know there was an issue of oxygenated blood being pumped back into my heart. \n\nI received yearly checkups until I was 16 when I was discharged from Sanger Health 2 years early because they were convinced I was fine. I am now 26 and am having the first sign of issues with my heart. \n\nI started getting a fluttering in my chest which I could feel and see as I am quite slim. They happened on and off pretty consistently for about 3-5 seconds at a time. On June 15th it started and lasted about 45 minutes straight. I went to the ER and was diagnosed with tachycardia and sent on my way after 8 hours of tests.\n\nTwo days later on June 17th it started again, altogether lasting an hour and twenty minutes. I went back to the ER and the doctor there told me I was having PVCs. He said they were benign and I had no reason to worry.\n\nI then went to a cardiologist at Sanger for a short “get to know you” visit on June 28th. I was fitted with a heart monitor for 24 hours. In that time I did not have any noticeable PVCs.\n\nLast night on June 30th I began having PVCs at 6pm that lasted until 12am. Today on July 1st I was also having them. Keeping track of them for a period of time I recorded at least 32 PVCs in the span of an hour with some lasting about 8 seconds.\n\nI am pretty much being told I am fine and being rushed out the door at each doctors visit. But I’ve read from Mayo Clinic that onset of ventricular arrhythmias in adults with corrected CHD often leads to sudden cardiac death with the patients often being very young at the time. \n\nI am quite worried as these PVCs are accompanied by shortness of breath and slight chest pains. Anyone with any knowledge or information on the matter would be great to hear from. Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/obvznt/sudden_pvcs_with_corrected_asd/

nwq1fh,1623337970,I [18M] am scared of my heart defect and would love it if someone could answer my questions,"So I was born with Dextro-Transposition of the Great Arteries which means that, compared to a lot of people on this sub, I'm probably pretty lucky. I don't currently have any restrictions on physical activity and my mother told me that a cardiologist told her that if you had to have a heart defect that this would be the one you should pick. I'm not sure if that's true or not.\n\nDespite all this, I'm still pretty terrified of it but I don't want to come of as ungrateful or anything. It's just that I don't know much about it and was wondering if people here did. \n\nI guess I just often think about how long I have left to live. I had an arterial switch operation done and the first time this was done successfully was back in 1975 so the original patient is 46 and from what I understand he is still alive although I don't know for sure. This means I could live to 46 which is nice but I don't know if this is statistically probable or not. He might have just gotten lucky and I'll die at 30 or possibly younger. To anyone who knows about this stuff I might be coming off as dramatic but I just don't know.\n\nEven if I could live to 46 that's still not really all that amazing. What if no one can make it to fifty and we just don't know yet? Before this procedure was done, a mustard procedure was done and if I understand correctly then some people made it to fifty with this but it definitely wasn't uncommon for you to not. However, I don't know if people were more likely to die in their forties or younger or not with this procedure. It's also possible that my procedure, although it makes complications less likely, actually gives patients a smaller life expectancy than the mustard procedure.\n\nAnd then the last thing would be the possibility of complications to my heart that could come up at any moment and kill me randomly in my sleep or just severely decrease my quality of life. I know that something like this happening to me at my young age is quite unlikely but what about at thirty? What about forty? And how unlikely is it really for it to happen right now? \n\nI think that covers most of it. Sorry, I know it's a long post and I got kind of rambly but I wanted to make sure I covered everything. I hope I'm just being dramatic and it's actually not a big deal but obviously I don't know for sure. It's hard to find studies on this stuff for people older than twenty. I also realize I should talk to my cardiologist about this and I will eventually but I don't see him until July so I thought maybe this subreddit could hold me over until then.

njynmn,1621864856,I have never heard a normal heart beat through a stethoscope,"I have had my CHD monitored for the last 20 years. I know only the sound of my heart beat. It’s a quick lub and slight pucker (regurgitation), then a whoosh (turbulence) with a dub. The dub is a little low. When I have the echo done usually I’m laying on my right side and slightly leaning forward. Now that I’ve studied more in cardiovascular and pathophysiology, I am gaining understanding of what I’m hearing. Since my defect, BAV, is in the LV that’s why the whoosh is during the second dub (diastolic). I think the techs measure it while I hold my breath after an exhale because it places max pressure on the valve for imaging. I listened to my heart with a stethoscope and I couldn’t believe how the details of the beating match with my diagnosis. I can’t wait to hear a normal heart beat using a stethoscope. I’ve heart from someone’s chest it seems much faster than mine, almost like each beat is quicker but then slight spaced more apart. I think the reason I know mine so well is from years and years of the sound on a monitor during appointments. Or even how they’ve played my heartbeat in the room for an hour during an MRI.

niyzhe,1621740375,Should I get the tricuspid repair or just pulmonary valve replacement?,"Hi everyone, first time posting here. I'm 41 and was born with critical pulmonary stenosis. I had surgery a few days after birth and then again at age 6. Fortunately both procedures went well and for the past 35 years I've only had to have cardiology checkups. I have significantly reduced exercise tolerance but otherwise live a normal life despite pulmonary and tricuspid valve leakage.\n\nRecently I noticed even more exercise intolerance and my cardiologist (at UPenn in Phila) believes it's time for a pulm. valve replacement. At first they thought I could just get that via transcatheter but after more testing they are concerned about tricuspid leakage and are advising a full open heart surgery to replace the PV and repair the TV. \n\nNow I have to decide whether to just do the pulm valve replacement with the catheter (which only has about a week recuperation time) and see if that improves my tricuspid leakage enough -- or do the full surgery and spend about 8 weeks recovering. I am seeing the cardiologist and cardiac surgeon next week for a full consultation and then will make the final decision.\n\nSo I'm wondering if anyone has any personal experience or input. Did anyone get PVR via catheter and see significant improvement of tricuspid leakage? Of course I want to listen to my cardiologists but I also don't want to get ""elective"" open heart surgery. However it may be that if I just do the PVR now, the tricuspid leakage will worsen to where I'll have to get that repaired anyway and so it might be best to just get everything done now. \n\nI've been so generally healthy for the past 35 years that it's a bummer to confront my heart condition now. On the positive side, though -- if you're a parent of a child with critical pulmonary stenosis, take my example and feel heartened that your child can live a normal life and not have to have more surgeries for decades :)\n\nThanks everyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/niyzhe/should_i_get_the_tricuspid_repair_or_just/

I have so many worries to be honest like about feeding problems and surgeries, but first I’m just curious about how moms of CHD babies gave birth and if there was a ‘best way’ in terms of helping the baby get off to a good start. I feel like Korean hospitals are going to push me towards a C-section but I honestly don’t know if that’s good for the baby or if it’s just what they feel comfortable doing. Of course if the cardiologist needs to do surgery right away maybe a planned c-section is needed but it just seems so different from my first birth, but also giving birth vaginally without medication required all my focus mentally and physically and I don’t know if I can recreate that in the strict university hospital setting. In any case, for the moms of CHD babies, how did you give birth and do you have any recommendations?",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/n37wue/32_weeks_pregnant_with_chd_baby_and_worried_about/

n0sp3n,1619655800,Aortic stenosis - how did you know it was time for surgery ?,"Me - 53 YO female , diagnosed with murmur at 30. My echos were done every five years and last year showed a pronounced change . I was diagnosed with a bicuspid valve, moderate to severe aortic stenosis . I also have Familial hypercholesterolemia - genetic issue with cholesterol . I am on repatha injections for the cholesterol .  Doctors think I inherited this from my dad , who passed away from massive stroke in his mid 70s. He had same heart issues with valve replacement in his 60s .  I was told I’ll need open heart valve replacement - but first the cardiologists thought I needed it ASAP , then in was a year out and at my last appointment they said 1-2 years . This was based on additional testing - second echo, heart cath, stress test, etc ... So, help me out ! I’m tired and short of breath but I also have chronic anemia and get iron iv infusions . I also had covid in dec . Add in I’m a single parent to four, including an adult son with autism and work full time as an engineer . Oh and 85 year old mom lives with me . So, when the doctors ask if I’m tired - yeah , I’m wiped out .  But how do I differentiate “tired by life” versus “tired because my heart is failing” .  How do the doctors know when moderate  becomes severe based on symptoms? I’d honestly rather get the surgery now - I’m concerned I’m a time bomb .  Thoughts?

I have had no further complications since the surgery; it’s was quite a success.\n\nI have always noticed that most times when I stand up [rather quickly, I’m quite energetic &amp; move pretty fast] that I start “seeing stars” and almost like tunnel vision at times. \n\nMost of the time, I personally don’t mind it, it’s honestly kinda like a 2 second buzz xD. But other times, I find it annoying because once I stand up, I tend to stay still to make sure that I don’t pass out (which has only really happened once, after a hot shower), because sometimes my body even feels tingly.\n\nI haven’t had a stress test or any cardiac tests (as I usually have them every 3 or 4 years now), but I do believe my doctors are aware of it. I forget if they said that it’s normal or what. Everyone tells me to “just get up slowly”, but I’m still energetic like a child and don’t always have the patience to standup slowly! Lol. \n\nDoes anyone else experience this? \n\nI’m just curious if it’s more of a heart condition thing, or if it’s just a ‘me’ thing.

mylhuu,1619396843,31 Year Old Congenital Heart Disease Patient AMA,"I originally posted this in another subreddit, but my wife found this one and I’d love to help any parents or anyone in a similar situation as me. \n\nI’m a 31 year old male who was born with congenital heart disease. I had atrial septal defect (ASD) and ventricular septal defect (VSD) both of which were repaired when I was 5. I was born with dextrocardia (my heart is on the right side), pulmonary stenosis, and congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries. \n\nI have had on the order of 10 heart surgeries and 3 open heart surgeries the latest being January 27th of this year. I had my first open heart surgery at 5 where the ASD and VSD were repaired and a valved conduit bypassing my pulmonary artery was placed connecting my morphological left ventricle (actually on my right side) to my pulmonary artery (see Rastelli Repair). \n\nI had my second open heart surgery at 14 where the conduit was replaced and my tricuspid valve was repaired. Both of these surgeries were performed by Dr. Laks at UCLA. \n\nIn July of last year exactly 16 years and 2 days after my last open heart surgery, my cardiologist replaced the valve in my conduit with a new Edwards SAPIEN 3 valve, and my new electrophysiologist placed a cardiac resynchronization device to help with my ventricular contraction and synchronization (my QRS complex was very wide).\n\nJanuary 21st of this year I went in to have a a procedure to help my tricuspid valve stop leaking, which was described as being “wide open for the past 10 years” by my cardiologist. That surgery ultimately failed, and I woke up to the news that I would be in the hospital until I could have open heart surgery to replace both my tricuspid and aortic valves. \n\nI then had to decide between mechanical and biological valves within a matter of days. I ultimately decided that it was necessary to give up my life of snowboarding, wakeboarding, dirt bike riding , horseback riding, and mountain bike riding and had two St. Jude/Abbott mechanical valves placed, one in the tricuspid position, and one in the aortic position by Drs Richard Shemin and Glen Van Arsdell.  Again, the surgery was performed at UCLA. \n\nI don’t think I’ve ever shared my story publicly, but I’ve never been secretive or ashamed to tell it when asked. I’ve just tried to live a normal life and not let it define me. As my wife got on Facebook groups to see others experiences during my last surgery -- and as others have encouraged me to share -- I came to realize that I may have some unique insight that could help others out. I don’t want the attention, but I also want to help. So... ask me anything and I’ll do my best to answer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/mylhuu/31_year_old_congenital_heart_disease_patient_ama/

mfi5sj,1616994204,"22 years old, Female. Born with Aortopulmonary window and Interrupted Aortic Arch","I was born a twin and I was 2 months premature. Weighing only 2lbs, doctors weren’t sure if I would survive. I stayed in the hospital, as doctors wanted me to gain enough weight before I went into surgery. I received an open heart surgery about 2 months later and there were unfortunately some complications so they had to do another one, which was thankfully successful. (Bare with me, I’m not too familiar with medical terms.) I was able to come home after a month of recovery, but my parents said it wasn’t easy. I was on oxygen for a bit until one day my dad couldn’t stand to see me in my condition and decided to take me off the oxygen. I made an improvement without the oxygen according to the doctors, so they decided to take me off of it. \nThe only memory I have going to the cardiologist was when I was 7 and then again when I was 13. Both times I was given an echocardiogram and everything seemed fine those times. I stopped going to my cardiologist until earlier this year when I had switched to a new general practitioner and they advised me to go see a cardiologist. Calling up my pediatric cardiologist to make an appointment was difficult within itself. They told me because I’m not longer a child, that I was able to make an appointment with a regular cardiologist, so I did. However, a few days later they called me back and reviewed my record and because of my “special case” they put me with a pediatric cardiologist. \nMy cardiologist ended up ordering a CT scan because it had been almost 10 years since my last visit. It’s vastly different from an echo, especially since I was given an IV for the contrast. Fortunately, everything turned out alright. There’s a small abnormality that they’ll keep an eye on as the years go by, but other than that, I’m alright! I don’t have to see them again until another 3 years. I don’t know, I’ve read other people’s cases on here and other places where they’re put on blood thinners or have to see their cardiologist every year and I feel guilty that I don’t have to do anything extensive. \nI just wanted to get this off my chest and/or see if anyone has the same conditions I have or have a lot of knowledge in it, because I have yet to know anyone with this kind of thing.

m4p40r,1615700733,"19F, update on heart... (got my diagnosis)","Hey all.  I posted a few days ago asking for some input w/ some heart issues I was having, and I first want to say thank you so much for all the advice I received. A lot of what you guys said helped me figure out what was up and eventually go to ER to confirm. \n\nTo put it short: mitral valve stenosis and hypokalemia. \n\nLong version: Because of my narrow pulse pressure, I strongly suspected stenosis of some kind. One user who I’m very grateful for advised me to ask somebody to listen for a murmur. As I didn’t have anyone that I could ask to listen for at least another week, I decided to shell out some money for a decent stethoscope. It arrived yesterday, and unfortunately I heard a quiet murmur, most audible in the mitral area. This, my ecg results, vitals, symptoms, and history led me to be fairly certain that the only thing this could be is rheumatic mitral valve stenosis. My bp was concerning enough last night (about 90/75) that I decided I’d rather be safe than sorry, and headed to the ER. \n\nThe ER immediately did an ECG and found signs of left atrial enlargement (p waves weird in lead II and V1) and decreased left ventricle size (low QRS). Because of the results, the murmur, my vitals, and arrhythmia, the ER ended up doing an echocardiogram. I also mentioned some bad muscle aches lately, so (as another user suggested) they checked my potassium along with some other stuff. \n\nThe echo findings indicated moderate mitral valve stenosis (nothing imminently dangerous thank god, still gotta get the specialists opinion tho) and blood test showed hypokalemia. \n\nGot strep all the time as a child and specifically got one severe bout of scarlet fever that was untreated for a long time. I guess now I know those god awful “growing pains” that made me miserable a few weeks after that was actually most likely rheumatic fever. \n\nAs for the low potassium? Adderall has killed my appetite so I just wasn’t eating enough I guess. Luckily that one is an easy fix. \n\nFor now, I got beta blockers and potassium supplements, and am going to see a cardiologist next week. \n\nI feel kinda numb rn tbh. I have a lot of other medical issues but I just never considered I’d have heart issues and especially so young. And I really just.... don’t know what to do. I love exercise and it kills me that it’s so hard and kinda risky to do rn. And my ADHD meds have helped so so much. I never took them as a child bc school was easy and I didn’t like how they made me feel, but now the difference is my semester GPA unmedicated vs medicated is a 2.7 vs a 4.0. I know health should be a priority but, man, a big part of me would rather prioritize grades. I was finally feeling happy again but now... :( \n\n\nAgain, thank you all for your advice on my last post. Every response was extremely helpful, and I just wanted to let you all know that the mystery has been solved. As this is not a CHD, I’ll no longer be posting on here, but I wish all the best and hope for healthy futures for all of you &lt;3",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/m4p40r/19f_update_on_heart_got_my_diagnosis/

m1apzu,1615308936,"19F, could congenital aortic stenosis been dormant until now?","For the last several months, I (19F, 5’7”, 130 lbs) have noticed a gradual decline in my systolic BP leading to a very narrow pulse pressure. Used to be 115-120/80-85, now it’s at 95/78. This narrow pulse pressure indicates low stroke volume of the heart, with either aortic or mitral stenosis as the only diagnoses I could find that make sense.  It can gotten so bad that she standing up, I always come close to fainting. I feel so tired and drained every day. \n\nMy resting heart rate is pretty much the same (70 bpm) however it now skips a lot of beats. If I stand up it jumps to about 155 bpm and stays above 110 bpm for several minutes. When I walk, my HR is around 170 bpm but it can peak as high as 190. Any exercise more than a brisk walk is out of the question as my HR instantly gets too high, I struggle to breathe, and my body starts to feel kind of numb as if I’m about to pass out. I was a competitive swimmer for 14 years, so this is extremely abnormal for me. \n\nBefore my symptoms really started, I had an ECG at a checkup. Results included: slight arrhythmia, low QRS voltage (every lead), notched P wave (lead II), deep negative P wave (lead V1), and unspecified T wave abnormalities. From what I gather, this could mean slight left atrial enlargement. \n\nAbout a month after my symptom onset, I started taking Adderall for my ADHD. The symptoms were mild enough at that point that I didn’t tell my doctor. \n\nMy question: would it have been possible for an aortic valve issue (biscuspid maybe) to be asymptomatic until age 19? If so, could the Adderall have contributed to the symptoms worsening relatively fast? I don’t believe Adderall to be the PRIMARY cause, as my issues are the same even going several days or a week without it. \n\nThanks in advance for any insight!

I ended up going to the hospital in July due to my heart feeling like it was beating crazily after smoking some weed (Was a daily smoker for about 4-5 years) and although it was just a normal panic attack. I didn't feel right after all of that and for about six months I didn't do much besides worry and let my anxiety get the better of me, it was a very demeaning experience and feeling as if I was on the cusp of death destroyed a lot of my own outlooks on life. I had always made sure to keep my heart rate below 100 bpm at all times with it only ever fluctuating above 100 when I was walking or doing anything stress related, it was a menial existence and today really proved my own body wrong. Of course my anxiety was crazy and I was sitting at around 140 bpm before I even started the test itself, but I did the test (rather poorly and not the best that I could do tbh), but knowing I had raised my heart rate to around 180-190 and nothing bad happened really opened my eyes to the fact that I wasn't just selling my mental shirt, but my body as well. My cardiologist said that I'm one of his best fontan patients he sees and I even got started on a physical program at the hospital so I can slowly ease myself into working out better and just trying my hardest to further myself.

lmkmhv,1613647474,PAPVR,"Hi Everyone. Guess I'm using this as therapy or something. I'm 22 years old... basically (in 6 days). In 1999 I had open heart surgery twice for my heart defect. Which was PAPVR...  I'm 95% sure (PAPVR for sure just don't remember if there were other things or not). If you don't know what this is, nor do I really. Just scares me I guess, last appointment I had about a year ago. My doctor basically told me that from here on out they don't know what will happen to me. Hence the checkups every two years. I had my stent widened in 2017 and that was the last procedure I have had. But idk... 22 years old and I still don't really know what the hell I'm dealing with... or even what I dealt with. My mom tells me all the stories every-time we get drunk together ahahah but idk I don't remember anything. Just wish I was aware I guess or had the memory of me going under for surgery and coming out. Wish i knew what it felt like to have my chest cracked open. Hopefully that doesn't sound weird. But just crazy how I will never know the pain I went through or if any pain. My doctors always would tell me I'm basically a miracle to still be living. My cardiologist, well ex-cardiologist since I'm too old now, loved me. Treated me and my family amazing. He would always tell me how the whole hospital watch him when i went under. Just wish I knew. And its not even me searching for that feeling of being special or anything, just wish i knew what I went through. Now I'm being told, I'm basically a living experiment who if i was born in 1998 I wouldn't be alive. It is fucking crazy and it scares the shit out of me. Just wish I knew I guess... Hoping to connect with other people who was born with PAPVR. Talk about it I guess, each others experience. Never have met someone with it. If you have read all of this than thank you very much &lt;3\n\n\-Tyler",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/lmkmhv/papvr/

lbgr8u,1612330922,Pro tips to all CHD moms/dads from a CHD child.,"Im no doctor, but I was born with one ventricle and other problems, 3 open heart surgeries (Fontan, Damus- Kaye- Stansel  and another one I don’t recall the name) 26 years later im super healthy, fit and graduating from law school, I have a girlfriend and good friends. If I don’t tell you or you don’t see my scars, you would never imagine I have a heart problem. My doctor in Boston says that my condition is amazing and I outperform most of my friends in physical activities. here are my tips. \n\n1. Enforce Daily exercise(5 times a week): I find swimming the best. Growing up and as a teen my parents out of fear never push me to do daily exercise nor to try to keep up with classmate and others. Big mistake. Most of my life I was a tad overweight. When I was 17 I took on Paintball and Swimming. I got fit, and performed even better than my paintball teammates. Yes I will never go pro, but still my life improved drastically. IMPORTANT**** Don’t be afraid to let your kid push himself or herself*******.Always tell him to follow and listen to his heart. I always knew when to stop. Im super healthy with absolutely no issues and live a normal life. The good thing of paintball and swimming is that I never have to give my 100% for more than 2 minutes and there is plenty of resting time. Swimming is great as a cardio activity, paintball also encourage team work and making friends. I also practice Martial Arts for a long time and I do encourage. Judo is great cause there are not punches or kicks but still full sparring.  I won a national championship in Brazilian jujitsu tho I stop it due to constant choking. So yeah, judo is better.  \n\n2. Enforce A healthy diet. comes hand in had with tip N.1 . \n\n3. When he/she gets older, be sure he/she knows how to drink. Im very thankful for my brother in this case. Alcohol and heart conditions are a no go. Now, young adults and alcohol go hand in hand for the most part. I barely drink, I know its not good for me, yet a cup of wine with my girlfriend is hard to refuse. So make sure you teach him the basic of good drinking. Just one cup or two, always at home, and always with a good meal or after one, never on an empty stomach. Til this day only once I felt sick due to alcohol and it was the day I did not eat well. I drink around 3 times a year only on special occasions, but I always feel good. \n\n4. Teach him discipline. Its very hard to live with the condition without discipline. Specially because some days you just feel tired and like sht. So discipline is key. \n\n5. Encourage Meditation. I started to meditate when I was 20. 5min a day of focusing on your breathing. I don’t  know the science behind it, but it works \n\n6. Encourage a rest day. One day a week of plain rest. No physical activities, diet or anything. It is good if he or she has a hobby at home. I like gaming but to each their own. \n\n7. No cigars. Please tell him not to smoke not be near smokers. \n\n8. Encourage studying and reading. There is a very very good chance, non of us will be the next Brady or Messi. On the other hand our brain is just fine. Still, always follow tip N. 1. \n\n9. Gaming is good. Our heart is not under stress and it’s a fun hobby for those rest days. \n\n10. This is very very important. Never make the kid  feel like he or she  is lesser or he cant so something. Not in sport or anything. Let the kid figure out where his limits are. I know this can be scary, but trust me, sometimes not even I knew how high my limits really were. \n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask. Any questions at all personal or not, feel free. \n\nHappy CHD month.",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/lbgr8u/pro_tips_to_all_chd_momsdads_from_a_chd_child/
lb9zvq,1612309149,"In honor of CHD Awareness, here's our story.","Since it's CHD Awareness Month, I figured it was time to share our CHD full story and I have no where to put it so here. Hopefully it helps someone feel less alone. (Also, sorry so long..probably could've written a book.)\n\nAt my 20 week anatomy scan, the ultrasound tech spent a few extra minutes on my son's heart. I could already feel that something wasn't right and later, my husband told me he felt it then too. She says she needs to get one of the doctors. They look and decide there may be a hole in his heart and we need to see a pediatric cardiologist. She tells us that it's a hole where it normally grows in and fills on it's own. \n\nThey made me wait a few weeks so the baby could get bigger and then I went in. We really weren't worried at all and figured everything would be fine after the reassuring words at the anatomy scan. They did an ultrasound on my belly and took about 100 pictures of his heart. Then the Cardiologist walks in and says there's some problems. I ask if we'll need surgery, and I kid you not, a laugh escaped him as he said yes. As if he was saying, ""Duh! Of course!"" \n\nWe listened intently as he drew pictures and explained the defects in our babies heart. All the things they would have to fix when he was just a few days old. DOLV, TGA, VSD! We were being indoctrinated into the world of CHD acronyms without even knowing it. \n\nWe cried and cried for 10 days straight. We had to consider whether or not we wanted an amniocentesis. They had told us (among a sea of other things) that the likelihood of a chromosomal abnormality was higher with the defect. I was not prepared to get more bad news and was hysterical at the prospect of losing him. I mean, we had already started on the nursery! \n\nI reached out in online communities. I wrote other CHD Mom's. I joined heart groups on social media. I pled with humanity to tell me it was going to be okay. I needed to believe that this baby we'd wanted for 10 years would be okay! \n\nOur next cardiologist appointment a month later went much better. They determined the defects were less serious than originally thought. They explained that we would get to take him home after birth. And that he wouldn't need surgery until he was 4-6 months old. Hearing news that would still make a ""normal mom"" hysterical had just made our whole day! \n\nSo, we had an appointment every 2-3 weeks for the rest of my pregnancy. We watched him and his heart grow! Things settled down and we did the best we could to enjoy our pandemic pregnancy. \n\nHe was born on Labor Day. After a terrible labor and delivery, he was finally here. And a new anxiety developed. How was his heart? How much did he weigh? We wanted him to be as big as possible for surgery. They waited until normal business on Tuesday and he got his first echo. We were fortunate that he was in our room and with us after delivery instead of the NICU and being grateful for that pushed us forward. \n\nWe took him home and the appointments began. He slowed on his weight gain already by 2 weeks old. With the lack of gain, they started following more closely. Appointments twice a week at different hospitals. Lots of times having 2-4 appointments in a single day. \n\nWe were constantly concerned he wasn't eating enough. We fortified his food (which just meant extra formula in the same amount of water) with extra calories. He just couldn't gain weight because his CHD had him so tired after just an ounce of fluid. He was always hungry, eating every two hours at most. In my mom groups, I watched babies his age start eating more and further apart. But he just couldn't. He was born in the 87th percentile and we watched that drop every week. \n\nIt. Was. Horrible. Those 10 weeks between birth and surgery (and probably 3 weeks following) were absolutely the hardest days of my entire life. Struggling with a heart baby, with zero help, in a pandemic completely unraveled me. I cried daily as I watched my fat chonker lose it all. My husband ""joked"" he had abs and I noticed his straight jawline. Things no 10 week old should have. \n\nWhen our son fell off of the bottom of the chart, they scheduled the surgery. We went in for one of his twice weekly weight checks on a Friday. This one was a pediatrician visit (we alternated between them and cardiology by week). And she says as she's looking at upcoming appointments, ""he has a covid test on Monday."" We knew he was getting one before surgery but surgery had been scheduled for a month later. We look into it and sure enough, surgery had been moved up to the following Wednesday. \n\nOur minds were blown. We couldn't tell if we were excited or devastated. We stared at him that whole weekend. Watched him, took pictures of him, cried over him. Neither of us knew if he'd survive surgery (prognosis was great!) and neither of us wanted to say it. But we both surrounded him with all of our love as if it were his last weekend on earth. I'm crying as I write this. No parents should have to spend a weekend with their baby with those thoughts in their mind. \n\nMonday and Tuesday were a flurry of appointments to prepare for surgery on Wednesday. We met with surgeons and specialists, he got echos, had to have blood taken, the covid swab. We didn't have time to do much but get ready. So we did. \n\nOn Tuesday night, we called the number to get the surgery time. They wanted us there at 6:30 am. Our little boy was so brave. He couldn't eat for 2 hours before surgery and before that only pedialyte. He laid in his hospital bed that morning, kicking and grunting for 2 hours. Starving. But never crying. He was so tough. Nurses and doctors came in asking all sorts of questions. And then, off he went. \n\nI'm going to tell you, watching my 10 week old baby get wheeled back to have his chest cut open was awful! I don't know how I stayed on my feet. And I wept!! \n\nThe next 4.5 hours we waited. We sat in the truck, overlooking Silver Lake, and we waited. I was getting text updates and finally we got the one we wanted the most at 12:42 pm, ""Patient is now off bypass. Main part of procedure is complete. Patient doing well."" Two hours later we were invited to talk with the surgeon and she was ecstatic with how well the surgery had gone. \n\nIt was another hour or so before we got to see him. Nothing, and I mean, NOTHING in the world could've prepared me for what we saw that night. I can't help but picture the horror of it. \n\nThey told us they had to take him off of his pain medication to be extubated until he was steadily breathing on his own. So they took that tube out and o.m.g. He was horrified. He was crying hysterically, but but was so out of it that his cries were silent. His face was so red, and swollen from all of the fluid they'd given him. He opened his eyes and looked at me for one second and I'll never forget the pain that was there. For hours he went through this. Whimpering with every single breath he took. My husband and I just took turns at his bedside rubbing his head and trying to soothe our infant son. \n\nFinally, he was allowed some pain medication and we had to sleep. Only one of us could stay (thanks, covid) so I did. And he cried on and off that whole night. \n\nThe next five days were spent in the hospital. The worst of it was over. But there was still a lot of bad left to go. Every day some new and horrible thing had to be done to him. Removing catheters and drainage tubes and pacemakers. Tube after tube had to be painfully pulled from his body over days. \n\nFive days later, they sent us home. This was much earlier than the standard but again..covid. That day and for days afterwards, he was scared. I mean, you could see in his eyes he was sad and scared. The night we brought him home, he had a full on panic attack. We had to watch our now 11 week old have a panic attack! \n\nThe weeks that followed were a steady uphill climb. Every day was better than the day before. We still haven't gotten the all clear from his cardiologist so when he only eats 4 oz instead 6 oz for a day, my mind goes there. I worry that the pinholes they saw are getting bigger. I worry he'll have to go through it again! \n\nSo, that's CHD for us. And we're lucky! We had one surgery and that should be all he ever needs. I still wouldn't wish this on anyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/lb9zvq/in_honor_of_chd_awareness_heres_our_story/

khykoj,1608613322,Advice on recovery time,"Curious on if anyone had any insight into recovery time for an aortic root and aortic valve replacement. I had the valve replaced with a biological valve when I was 13, and only vaguely remember the overall experience; being 13 I bounced back pretty quick. But I’m 32 now and it needs to be replaced again. Going mechanical this time and they’re doing the aortic root procedure at the same time. I’m single and live alone a bit far from my family, so my sister is coming to stay with me during all this and I’m trying to gauge how long she should stay. Being relatively young, fit, and in otherwise good health my doctor suggested three weeks off work at a minimum, possibly four but because I climb towers for a living and work at height in a harness with fall risks, he said it could be shorter or longer depending on many factors. Even if I can’t climb I don’t think my sister needs to stay with me the entire time, I’m sure at some point I’ll be able to take care of myself well before I’ll be able to go back to work. If you’ve had similar procedures done, what was your recovery time like as far as being able to be independent versus being able to work (at a desk job vs a more physical job. My job is such that I could send my team to climb and I could just be a desk jockey for a bit if I needed to).

I could tell during the ultrasound that they were having a hard time getting the view they needed since he wasn’t cooperating. I ended up going to my appointment with my OB and then coming back for them to capture a couple images they couldn’t get which included his heart. \n\nWe got our test results back through my online chart and the summary noted from my OB said that they were referring us to a perinatologist to complete a fetal echocardiogram because there were “limited views of the heart” which made me believe he just wasn’t cooperating. As I scrolled through the rest of the notes, the cardio section indicated the heartbeat was normal at 142, rhythm was normal, 4 chambers of the heart were seen, 3 vessel trachea was seen and normal, left outflow tract seemed normal, but the 3 vessel view and right outflow tract were “sub-optimally visualized” as well as there “appearing to be a dilated left atrial sinus”.  It then noted that outside of the dilated left atrial sinus, there were no other gross abnormalities and they recommend that we got an echocardiogram. \n\nWhen my clinic called, I realized I was going to a completely different location, had to have genetic counseling first, and then will be completing the echo. Husband and I are obviously worried because this doesn’t seem normal, but could we be overthinking it?  The notes my doctor left made it seem like they just didn’t get good imaging but the appointments and orders he made makes the dilation of his left atrium seem far scarier than the tone of his notes. We have scoured the internet and don’t see this in a lot of fetuses and assume it’s probably linked to an actual CHD but we can’t even begin to figure out which one if any. \n\nAny thoughts are appreciated if you have seen similar issues with the left atrium in a fetus.",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/kb5th1/20_week_ultrasound_results_echocardiogram_needed/

I’m 22 weeks into my pregnancy with our baby girl. This is our first child. \n\nI received 3 anatomy ultrasounds. One initial ultrasound and 2 follow-up scans. After the 1st and 2nd scan there was a question of the baby having a “relatively small” LVOT (left ventricle outflow tract) OR they just weren’t able to get a clear image due to technique and/or position of the baby. Baby was laying on her side for 2 of the appointments. They also so a echogenic intracardiac focus (EIF) on her heart as well.\n\nAfter ultrasound #3 we were told that there was a possible perimembranous VSD, but they didn’t say any additional information on the size of the LVOT in the report from ultrasound 3.\n\nOur world was absolutely rocked. Neither I, nor my fiancé have a CHD, but we think there may be a distant relative on his side who was born with one (we don’t have further info). He is also of West Asian descent which we were told could be why baby has an EIF. \n\nWhat we know:\n-That the severity and treatment of the VSD depends on location and size. Genetics told us it could heal on its own if it’s small enough or it could require surgery in her first 6 months of life. That was a really wide range of treatments. They even mentioned a possibility of me having to deliver in a bigger major city about 2 hours away if it were severe. \n\n-Small LVOT\nI don’t have much information on this other than they hope to get more complete images on Tuesday morning at our Level 2 ultrasound. This is the part that downright scares me\n\n-EIF\nwe were told this was most likely unrelated to possible defects and was not “additive” in terms of severity for her possible defects\n\nThe other question we have is about chromosomal disorders. I did have an NIPT and my result was low risk. Also all of her other measurements were on track and even, which the doctor said was a good indicator that this is not related to a chromosomal disorder. \n\nDo any parents have any advice or any adults who know about these defects have any experience?

jc6hck,1602838631,Recovering from a thorocotomy due to my pacemaker wires finally giving out after 28 years.,"I recently posted for the first time on this sub not too long ago introducing myself. I had just gotten a new pacemaker implanted for 8th time and felt my story was worth telling. Well 3 months after that surgery I find out that the old wires are finally giving out. We (my team of doctors and I) knew this was coming but thought we could squeeze a few more years. So going into my second thorocotomy; my first one was when I was 7 years old, I knew it wasn't going to be an easy surgery to recover from. \n\nThorocotomy surgery is listed as the most painful surgery. They cut through back muscle, probably a 6-8 inch incision. They can then look at a lung that might have a problem or in my case hook up new wires to a heart. The doctors managed to get 3 new wires on the heart 2 ventricular and 1 atrial. Now I'll be able to extend the life of my heart by having 3 nodes attached instead of 1 which makes my heart now beat like a regular person instead of just pump, being that its a single chamber heart because of my defect. \n\nSo I went in for surgery... again... but this one is not a walk in the park. Like my previous pacemaker replacements were. I'm 10 days post surgery and have only recently been able to be cleared to go home.  It's a humbling experience everytime a surgery needs to happen. I'm alive and after the wave of pain I'm experiencing right now subsides I'll be happier and healthier than I was. To anyone out there that might need a good story.

I drink 1 cup of coffee each day, only drink 1 CocaCola when a migraine hits (several doctors informed me of this technique, it actually helps).

Some background on me:\n\nI’m 25, and I have several CHDs, primarily Tricusid Atresia (with Fontan circulation), but also including restrictive VSD, TGA, valvar aortic stenosis and aortic coarctation w/ hypoplastic arch.\n\nDespite that, cardiologically I’m actually in about the best condition I could be - I haven’t had any noticable restrictions through life except for potentially running out of breath sooner than expected when exercising, and I only take warfarin for blood thinning. I have the occasional stent reballooning and catheter, but other than that I’ve been fairly procedure-free since ~7.\n\nWhich is why it’s so frustrating the liver seems to be being hit faster than usual.\n\nFor those who don’t know, the fontan circulation provides a single-circulatory system (where blood goes around both the body and lungs prior tl returning to the heart), at the long-term cost of weird pressures that organs aren’t really built to cope with. Primarily this leads to liver disease - I’m not sure what the ‘normal’ period would be before this sets in.\n\nIn the past couple of years I’ve had a few endoscopies and full blood tests, and cirrhosis seems to be setting in. I have a few esophagal varices (banding has been delayed by covid), and I was wondering if anyone else had experience with this. Obviously the vast majority of resources are targetted at alcohol-related cirrhosis, and I’ve found information to be thin on the ground for other types. It doesn’t help that this situation is so rare, of course!\n\nI know it may come to a heart/liver transplant (because the heart is the ultimate cause, they wouldn’t do a simple liver transplant). I’ve managed to blind myself to the long-term potential realities of my conditions until now, so it’s all come as a bit of a rush. Every time I forget something or get distracted, fatigued or confused, I’m asking myself ‘is this how I normally am, or hepatic encephalopathy?’ (The brain eventually gets hit by toxins the liver can no longer filter out).\n\nSo yeah, I guess my main question is whether anyone else has experience with this, and how it went?

i3xfd5,1596595979,Adult (now 42!) with update to aortic stenosis and Qs for people who've had AVR,"Hi all!\n\nI posted with some details about my situation last year here:\n\n [https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/cwfme7/adult\_41\_with\_aortic\_stenosis\_seeking\_some/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/cwfme7/adult_41_with_aortic_stenosis_seeking_some/) \n\nIn the year since my last visit, I've felt just fine, haven't had any issues with exercise--in fact I'm getting more strenuous walks every day now that we're working from home during the pandemic! So I was surprised to go in for my annual echo today to find out that things have gotten worse. My cardiologist seemed surprised that I'm not displaying any symptoms.\n\nPeak velocity is up to 4.6m/s from what was a stable 4.0 for years. Dilation/aneurysm up to 4.8 cm, after being unchanged at 4.5 for 7 years.\n\nShe's ordered a stress test, so I'll be going in to do that as soon as I can. Depending on those results, it sounds like it may be valve replacement time.\n\nSo, I've got some questions if anyone out there has any answers :) \n\n1 - My cardiologist assured me that a mechanical valve makes the most sense in this situation. She's definitely a well-respected doctor in her field, so I take what she says as the best recommendation. Given my age, wanting to avoid another surgery to replace a failing biological valve makes sense. Would anyone opt for a biological valve in my situation? How limiting is going on blood thinners for the rest of my (probably another 30-40 year) life? I love hiking and I fear this will be a big restriction on that. Not to mention the monthly visits to the clinic will make some of the long trips I take a bit more problematic (we have family overseas and spend months at a time with them)\n\n2 - My cardiologist also assured me that there's no real impact to lifespan given I'm perfectly healthy otherwise. Obviously increased risk of stroke but otherwise normal. It's been \*insanely\* difficult to find any useful research on this. Most studies are on patients who had the surgery in their 60s-70s when they only had another 10-20 years left to live anyway. I'm not sure where to find reliable info for mechanical AVR for patients in their 40s. Again, I trust her word, but looking for some corroborating statistics if anyone has them. I've got kids to finish raising after all :) \n\n3 - For people who've had AVR, how was the recovery? I don't qualify for TAVR because they have to repair the aneurysm as well. So crackin' me open is the only option. Also, after recovery, did you notice any quality of life changes afterwards? My assumption is that \*something\* should feel different, whether it's energy levels or stamina, considering how restricted the blood flow is right now. Mostly just curious, since I've obviously never been through this before and I know some of you have :)\n\n4 - Lastly, what sorts of complications did you run into post-AVR? Anything I should plan on? Or any recovery tips to make things go smoother? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks all for your time reading this and responding! This is all scary stuff that I'm feeling pretty good about on most days, but the more info I can gather from people who are on the other side of AVR, the better I'll feel :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/i3xfd5/adult_now_42_with_update_to_aortic_stenosis_and/

i1wy0c,1596306299,Vagus nerve damage from open heart surgery?,"I had an 26mm ASD repair on 6/10. After the surgery, my heart rate was constantly elevated (120s-140s). But when i would lie down, my heart rate would slow significantly (into 40s), and i would go into junctional rhythm transiently, and then my heart rate would go back up to 70s-80s. When my heart rate slowed, I would feel lightheaded.\n\nCould the surgery have caused some sort of damage to the vagus nerve, causing it to be hyperactive? My doctor placed me on a beta blocker, which lowered my resting heart rate. He said that the large variability in my heart rate from 130 to 40s was causing the problem, and by lowering my resting heart rate from 130s to 90s, it would prevent my heart rate from going into 40s. It actually did help, and i had less supine bradycardia. But the beta blockers caused me to have insomnia, so i’ve been taken off of those.\n\nIf my vagus nerve was damaged, will it fully heal, or will i need a pacemaker?",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/i1wy0c/vagus_nerve_damage_from_open_heart_surgery/
i1iv7t,1596241511,Stressing over my son's latest cardiologist appt results and they're not even that bad. He has BAV.,"Hi.  I know I'm overreacting and stressing out over nothing.  Everyone tells me this.  I get it.  I'm just bothered by this.  My son has BAV which they saw in-utero along with 3 holes in his heart.  Luckily, the holes closed.  We were told that BAV was no big deal, and that we would have to go come in every 3 years for an appt until he was 12-13, and then every 5 years.  This should not be an issue until he is an adult.  Well, it's been a few years and everything has been fine until this appt. His valve is leaking a little and he had an ascending aorta which is at a 3.3 right now.  Now we have to go back next year to make sure it doesn't get any bigger.  The doctor said he might grow into.  He said it's nothing to worry about, just monitor.  Steer him away from contact sports.  I guess what bothers me is that his BAV has always been out of sight, out of mind.  We actually went 4 years in-between this appt and last times.  It was just an inconvenience every 3 years.  Now it seems a little more real and I wasn't expecting this.  I'm trying to educate myself more and of course upon Googling congenital heart defects, Coronavirus comes up.  We don't go anywhere and mask up if we go to stores, but again, it didn't even occur to me that he could possibly get seriously ill if he contracts it.  His cardiologist said he's low risk, which is good, but still worried.  If there's anything you want to share or relate to, I'm here to listen.

I have tetralogy of fallot and recently found out that my condition has worsened to where I’ve developed ventricular tachycardia. \n\nI have sort of a weird/interesting question and was curious if there's anyone in the group who has an answer or some experience. \n\nBack in January, I got hired for my first job right out of college; shortly after starting the position, I had to take time off because I was in the hospital. The morning I returned to work, I was called into a meeting with the company's HR and my manager during which I was told that I was seen ""as a liability to the office and needed to leave immediately after the meeting was over."" I was devastated after this happened because I was so proud of myself for finding a highly professional and well-paying job directly after graduating-- I felt like a failure and like my health was holding me back from living a normal life. After taking time to focus on my physical and mental health, I realised I should still be proud of myself and I WILL accomplish everything I set my mind to. \n\nSince then, I've had to take time off indefinitely from getting a job because I've been very sick on and off. During this time, I've been looking for potential remote positions for when I'm able to start working again, but lately, I've been yearning to find a position where I'm helping people and making a positive change in their lives.  \n\nHere's where my question comes in: has anyone had any experience in working for Congenital Heart Disease foundations or as a Congenital Heart Disease speaker? My dream is to be able to work with younger kids who are going through the early stages of learning to live with a CHD and encourage them to find ways to live beautiful and fulfilling lives; however, I would love to be apart of sharing my words and experience with any audience I can. I want my voice to matter in this community, but I'm not sure where to start. \n\nI appreciate if you've read this far, thank you for making my words important!

Some people think of it as a curse, my wife and I on the other hand have always embraced my yeti-like nature.\n\nThis year for my yearly cardiologist appointment (30 y/o - repaired TOF as an infant) I decided to try what was originally unthinkable to me and shave my chest ahead of time. Sure I look like a naked mole rat and it’s a super bizarre feeling on my chest but at least I won’t have the terrible post Holter rip!\n\nIt has made a WORLD of difference! For the stress test it was a little annoying with how much the tech wiped my chest, but when it came to the ECG it was so so seamless! No ripped hair, no squealing as the feeling of a half dozen bandaid like adhesives are torn from my chest.\n\nCurrently I’m sitting at home with my least favorite machine ever (the Holter) but I have a feeling it won’t be nearly as bad as prior years where I stubbornly only shaved patches where the leads needed to be. I already went to the bathroom and forgot it was attached as I stood up (we’ve all been there) and it didn’t stop me in my tracks with hair pulling pain as it normally would.\n\nI’m sure it’ll get itchy as the summer goes on, but the patchy chest style was itchy already.

hidpag,1593481405,Experience having a full term baby in NICU,"My son has a borderline aortic arch hypoplasia. We won’t know until birth whether it resolves more with closure of ductus arteriosus or becomes a coarctation. The plan is to start him on prostaglandins right first birth until cardiology can get echos on him\nAnd figure out what the plan is... we are told right now it’s 50/50 on whether he will need surgery or not. So needless to say, he will be going to NICU after birth. I have been followed by high risk and been assured that other than his heart issue he seems to be a pretty hearty and healthy little dude. \nI have joined a lot of nicu groups to kind of get a feel for what it will be like, but 99% of the info and how things go for baby while there, are based upon baby being a preemie. I’m currently 37 weeks pregnant and he is measuring a decent size, so most of this will not pertain to him.\nSo I’m coming to you guys in hopes to get a better idea of what our early days will look like. I’m assuming they will allow me to hold him as much as I like and breastfeed, provide care assuming he is stable enough? I know with preemies they measure pretty much everything that goes in and out of them, but wouldn’t there be less need for that since he will be full term? He likely won’t have the temperature regulation issues etc and hopefully not the breathing issues unless his arch coarcts or he has a bad reaction to prostaglandins. Will they be a bit more chill with him than they are with these super small preemies? \nMaybe it’s just my nerves as we approach my due date and I have no idea what to expect besides what the doctors tell me. They have answered some of these questions for me, I guess I just need reassurance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/chd/comments/hidpag/experience_having_a_full_term_baby_in_nicu/
