uelh3i,1651237438,Phototherapy vs Skyrizi,"hi everyone, first thank you for all of the information sharing here. it's been very helpful.\n\n**long story shortened to simple question: if given the choice between phototherapy and skyrizi, all other things being equal, which is a better option?** \n\ni'm 51 - diagnosed last summer with psoriasis for the first time. bad plaques on elbows and knees for months until i got an appt with a dermatologist (actually a PA), started enstilar, which cleared up plaques so the large patches are better but still distinct, and now i have smaller red spots all over my body. i don't like my PA because she doesnt give any advice or insight at all.\n\nin march the PA suggested phototherapy; when i found out the out of pocket cost of about 200/session and 2-3 sessions a week, i balked -- i'm nearing the end of my insurance year and my deductable situation will be bad -- so the next option was a biologic bc she said the drug that would be next (i forget the name) has significant side effects that might worsen my significant ptsd/depression/anxiety. a nurse ambassador called me about the skyrizi and said that it would likely be only $5 out of pocket once they did whatever bs bureaucratic insurance nonsense to it, and i liked that. \n\nmy insurance then rejected skyrizi because i hadn't tried phototherapy. so i made an appt and talked to that nurse for a while bc she was very helpful. we figured we could start with a few appts and see if it works and then maybe try again to get the biologic approved.\n\ntoday i find out that the dermatologist had contacted insurance to get skyrizi (in the days i was making my own plans for phototherapy) pushed thru and it worked. so now i have an appt for phototherapy but have also been approved for the biologic. i'm not sure what to do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/uelh3i/phototherapy_vs_skyrizi/

I recently had the worst flare up I’ve had, and I believe the severity was caused from using enstilar during the early stages of the flare. My doctor said we could look at bioligcs if I wanted, since I told him I was hesitant to use any steroid topicals after what the enstilar did. \n\nI’m curious though, if I start a biologic and get clear, is there a good chance I stay in remission after I’m off? Like I said, most of the time my psoriasis isn’t noticeable at all, and every flare up I’ve had usually clears up for the most part within months.

I was referred to a dermatologist who started me out on methotrexate, which I was on for a short while before having a catastrophic injury and was off any kind of treatment for about half a year.

I bloody loved the trial, it completely cleared up my psoriasis and I was able to live a normal life.\n\nMy dermatologist then put me onto Otezla (apremilast), and it seemed to work for a while, but it has less than satisfactory effects. The psoriasis has returned on my face, and to a lesser degree on my elbows, but most frustratingly, in my nails. I'm constantly ripping/tearing my nails on things, and they are really unsightly, which makes me feel very self-conscious - a real comedown from where I was when I was on the injectable.\n\nI'm just feeling really down at the moment, with all of this, and I don't have another appointment with my dermatologist for another few months.

I’ve had a referral to a dermatologist and they put me on methotrexate for a bit under supervision, until my blood tests came back looking worrisome and they told me to stop taking it. That was about a year ago and I hadn’t noticed any improvements even while on the medication. \n\nI am a student on my year abroad so my doctor has essentially said there’s nothing they can do for me while I’m not in the uk as anything they’d want to put me on would require regular check ups etc. So I’m stuck using topical stuff, clobetasone on my face and enstillar on my body. \n\nThis only works temporarily in reducing irritation, never ridding me of redness, and I can’t use it for too long for obvious reasons. However having read up on it I’m concerned that using it over such a huge area of my body could’ve caused the scales to grow after I stop treating them. \n\nWhat I want to focus on before I can get back to the UK is lifestyle changes while I’m living alone and abroad.\n\nI’m a very heavy drinker and heavy smoker and living alone abroad has also caused my stress to skyrocket, along with other mental health issues some of which I am medicated for. I know all of these things can contribute to flare ups etc, but I’m concerned as I will use things like drinking and smoking to ease stress and other mental health concerns. None of it healthy by any means, and I’m eating like shit and exercising rarely if ever. \n\nWhat dietary changes have people made? I’m trying to tackle things gradually as it’s all so intertwined, it’s so intimidating to try and make a change especially when I’m used to seeing little to no results. Of course I will be trying to cut down on drinking and smoking, but beating addiction is no easy feat \n\nStress and bad habits make it worse, which drives me back to bad habits and stresses me out.\n\nIt’s a bit of a daunting task, so any pointers of where to start would be much appreciated. \n\nLove",https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/ua8w2s/advice_for_lifestyle_changes_to_help_psoriasis/

u7ra1r,1650441251,Undiagnosed potential scalp psoriasis here. Do I use the steroid shampoo that my doctor prescribed me or wait to see my dermatologist for a diagnosis?,"Hey all, I was hoping to run my situation by the seasoned vets on here. (29/f) I’m quite certain that I have scalp psoriasis. This would be my first flare up. \n\nAround Thanksgiving I had COVID. My theory is that getting sick was what triggered the immune response (if I do have SP.) Around this time I started noticing what I thought was bad dandruff, however I’ve never struggled with dandruff before in my life and thought this was odd.\n\nA month later I had my hair done. I waited about 5 days after getting my hair dyed to wash it. 5-7 days later while frantically trying to get my stuff together for the holidays I noticed my scalp was incredibly inflamed and red and peeling and scaley. At the time I was convinced I was having an allergic reaction to the hair dye. But this also has never happened to me before. And it had been a week since the salon. \n\nA few months passed and my scalp very gradually continued to worsen. I have bad days and good days, they seem very dependent on stress and what I put into my body. Alcohol seems like a major trigger. The moment a white claw touches my lips I can feel my head itching. I should also note that I’ve had a very stressful year, probably record-breaking stress as a matter of fact lol. I bought a dandruff shampoo at some point which didn’t seem to do much. \n\nAfter months of dealing with this on and off I finally called my dermatologist. The soonest they could get me in was a month down the road. I took the appointment then called my primary care physician who I knew could probably see immediately. \n\nMy primary care took a very quick look and told me he thinks it’s fungal/Tinea Capitis. He prescribed me Ketoconazole shampoo which I used 3 times and noticed no difference / my scalp just continued to worsen. I didn’t want to keep using this heavy duty antifungal shampoo while seeing no results so I put it aside.\n\nI was talking to my dad a few days ago and he casually informed me that both he and his mother (his mother severely, him less severely) suffered from psoriasis their entire lives. This information kind of sealed the deal for me. I followed up with my primary doctor and told him that I’d like to try a psoriasis steroid shampoo. He prescribed me Clobetasol shampoo. I have not used it yet. \n\nSo here’s where I’m at. Any input based on my timeline and details would be welcomed and greatly appreciated, but I just have a gut feeling that I’m dealing with scalp psoriasis. (It’s unfortunately very difficult for me to get a look at what I’m dealing with because I have so much hair. I should’ve taken a picture when the flareup was affecting my front hairline.) My dermatologist appointment is two weeks from now. What would you do in my situation? Do I use the steroid shampoo that my primary care physician prescribed me for scalp psoriasis, or do I wait until my dermatologist appointment for a diagnosis (hopefully via a biopsy)?\n\nI know this entire predicament probably sounds like a stupid issue, and it’s like why not just use the Clobetasol shampoo - if it works it works. But if my condition improves and moreover if it disappears by the time my dermatologist appointment comes around, I won’t be able to receive a diagnosis… Correct? \n\nThe bottom line is I’d just really like to know if I do have psoriasis (and if not what exactly I’m dealing with) so I can know what’s going on with my body. And how I can treat and avoid triggers moving forward. \n\nToday my scalp was fine, yesterday it was terrible, who knows how it’s going to be tomorrow. I just ordered some Derma E shampoo and conditioner and a nice scalp massager/brush off Amazon. I can deal with discomfort. But I’m worried about hair loss. Or any sort of permanent damage that comes from putting off treating psoriasis that I might not know about. \n\nAny input and advice in my situation would be awesome.

u68omv,1650272627,Hello everyone! I just found this subreddit early this morning after waking up from an itch...,"Hi guys! I am mostly a reddit lurker. I usually just read interesting things and move on with my day without ever posting or commenting.\n\nI honestly was surprised there is a whole subreddit for this, and your stories have brought me so much encouragement. Some of you are experiencing amazing treatments! Some of you definitely have it worse than I do, while others psoriasis isn't as bad as mine. I suppose I fit somewhere in the middle.\n\nI developed psoriasis one day after going to the gym about 4-5 years ago. It started as a small spot on my right knee. Today I have it really bad on my elbows and knees, flakes on my face, and in my ears. I have two big spots on the side of my left leg and small spots in other various places.\n\nIt has made me stop going out. It is embarrassing as all hell and people don't understand it.\n\nThe flakes drive me bat shit insane and I'm constantly vacuuming or sweeping. \n\nI've tried numerous ointments through the years. I've used aquaphor (which really keeps it moisturized) as well as Eucerin, salicylic acid, and others.\n\nThe itching is what depresses me the most. It never ever stops. I can't play video games, enjoy time with my son, sleep, eat...I am constantly itching somewhere.\n\nI've recently started using using baking soda baths. I grabbed a common kitchen sponge and have taken to putting baking soda on the rough side and then rubbing my scales raw. The scratch is orgasmic and the relief that comes after seems to last for about a 24 hr period. Sometimes it bleeds REALLY BAD.\n\nAnyway, that is my psoriasis journey so far. I am hopeful that once 5th winter is over that I can spend more time outside sitting under the sun.\n\nI wish you guys well on your quest to battle the ever-itching demon.

I've also had Psoriatic Arthritis since I was 11. I'm writing a series about managing Psoriasis via lifestyle changes -- either to manage without meds if you find them intolerable, or to bolster a medication routine that isn't quite getting the job done.\n\nYou can read part one here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/u2j1ej/thoughts\_from\_an\_longtimer\_part\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/u2j1ej/thoughts_from_an_longtimer_part_i/)\n\nAnd here's part two:[https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/u3yc3i/thoughts\_from\_a\_long\_timer\_part\_2\_hands\_and\_feet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/u3yc3i/thoughts_from_a_long_timer_part_2_hands_and_feet/)\n\nTriple down and read part three, too: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/u3z4fz/thoughts\_from\_a\_longtimer\_part\_3\_clothes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/u3z4fz/thoughts_from_a_longtimer_part_3_clothes/)\n\nMy other posts have been a numbered list of dos and don'ts, but this one will be more freeform than that because food and psoriasis is a weird, murky place. There are a lot of diets out there on the internet that claim to cure it, and you'll find adherents to all of them. I absolutely recommend reading up on them because it has been my experience that food absolutely triggers my skin to go nuts. But none of them are gospel and I hope this explains why and helps you find the right food for you.\n\nFrom a 30,000 foot view, various ethnicities across the globe evolved to eat differently, albeit there are great similarities at the macronutrient level because all humans have the same basic nutrition needs. While no ethnicity has evolved to eat what would poison another human, a good example of ethnic diet differences would be European retention of lactose tolerance vrs lactose intolerance in most asian ethnicities. Common food allergies are, in fact, not common everywhere.  Nut allergies are nearly unheard of in Japan. They are ridiculously common in the west.  People of European descent are much more likely to experience celiac disease than someone who is Hispanic. I bring this up because as far as I can tell, ethnicity can help zero in on your food triggers faster. You'll need to know what foods are commonly associated with the peasantry of your ethnicity BEFORE the discovery of the New World, and what were foods commonly considered poisonous or upsetting to the humors. For instance, if you are are German descent, you can easily say ""okay, way back when, there was probably some quantity of cured meats, very little fish, plenty of cheese, plenty of wheat, plenty of fermented stuff.""  If you don't know your ethnicity, no worries, the Blood Type diet is a perfectly good starting point as well, but understand, you are going to need to misuse the information a bit. You want to come out with a list of common foods that were eaten all the time, common food allergies for your ethnicity, and a list of foods commonly held to be gross or suspicious.  \n\nEliminate all of them from your diet for two weeks. All of them. (So basically, anything the blood type diet says to eat, you won't be eating at first.) You'll probably be eating root vegetables sans potatoes, chicken, and non-citrus fruits, and little else, but this isn't forever. Slowly add foods back in, starting with the least suspicious (for me, potatoes) to most suspicious (for me, gluten) until you get symptoms. Then take that food back out. There will be a great deal of experimentation, and there can be some weird combos that you might not expect, where you can eat two foods, just not together. You may also find that you can tolerate small amounts of a food, but not large amounts, or you may find that you can eat a certain amount of bothersome foods in any combination, but you can only have so much, perhaps a cheat snack, before symptoms come on.\n\nSome words to the wise:\n\n1. Don't put in a lot of modern day substitutes to the elimination part of the diet. Treat substitutes as new, suspicious food groups that you need to determine are safe. I react to gluten. Most substitutes are EVEN WORSE. \n2. Take a good multivitamin -- you will lose some vitamins doing this, and a deficiency can make you feel worse than the triggering food.\n3. Don't beat yourself up if you screw up, just start over the next day.\n4. Remember that symptoms will come on slowly -- my hands get terrible several days after exposure to a trigger, so introduce new foods slowly to the diet so you can figure out which foods cause trouble.\n5.

I am also prone to eczema on my hands, and I have Crohn's disease. \n\nI went for a pedicure with a friend last summer with a friend, and they have some callous off of the bottom of my foot. Since then, skin has been growing quite quickly on the bottom of my foot, and then coming off in dry chunks, and the patch has been growing and getting more angry. The extent of the damage is more visible after soaking for about 10 minutes, but you can see it even when my foot has been not been soaked. At first I thought t was fungal, but antifungal treatments did not help, so I have tried the betaderm on it three times daily for last 6 weeks, but it has not really made any difference either. It does not really look like the plaques that I get on my elbows and knees, but it also does not look like eczema, but then I am not sure what plantar psoriasis is supposed to look like or how one is supposed to make it get better.

u3z4fz,1649994168,Thoughts from a Longtimer Part 3: Clothes," Hi! I've had Psoriasis symptoms since I was 4, diagnosed at 8, and am now in my late 30s. I've also had Psoriatic Arthritis since I was 11. I'm writing a series about managing Psoriasis via lifestyle changes -- either to manage without meds if you find them intolerable, or to bolster a medication routine that isn't quite getting the job done. \n\nYou can read part one here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/u2j1ej/thoughts\_from\_an\_longtimer\_part\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/u2j1ej/thoughts_from_an_longtimer_part_i/) \n\nAnd here's part two:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/u3yc3i/thoughts\_from\_a\_long\_timer\_part\_2\_hands\_and\_feet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/u3yc3i/thoughts_from_a_long_timer_part_2_hands_and_feet/)\n\nFor me, clothes are actually a complicated part of how I manage my psoriasis. I don't think this is talked about at length the way it could be. I do see some posts about ""wear natural fibers"" and I suppose for some folks that may very well be the long and the short of it. However, I find that is not true for me. I have to be very specific. The following are a starting point, from years of experience. Your mileage may vary.\n\n1. Yes, I agree that natural fibers seem to be the most likely to cause no issue. I can also wear nylon blends. I cannot wear acrylic (most inexpensive sweaters) or polyester (exception, I found a wool/poly blend that worked for me, so... I remain confused as it only that product, only that brand.) I can do some spandex/elastane. Some folks can't. The jury is out on Rayon/Bamboo. Modal sucks for me.\n2. Smooth athletic clothes can feel amazing when I first put them on, but those plasticy materials cause all kinds of trouble after an hour. Kind of like I have one giant invisible patch shaped like the garment I had on. Softness and smoothness are important to many sufferers, but they aren't the final arbiters of if something will be comfortable to wear all day.\n3. I can't wear your standard cotton knit tee. I don't think it really makes much sense to go into why I think that is true, I think what's important is that a cheap t-shirt from Walmart or Target is agonizing for me. Cheap cotton leggings are awful for the same reason. I feel like knit cotton catches and tugs on every flake, every jagged edge of my skin, and rasps over it all day long. I hate, hate, hate, hate, a cotton t-shirt anymore. Cotton is very soft, but it's not smooth. Modal is worse. \n4. I do wear knits, however. I find that very smoothly knitted wool and silk can be next to my skin and be comfortable. I like Smartwool underlayers, and LL Bean's silk longer underwear. Lightweight silk is comfortable into the summer for me, so if you need plain tees, this could work.  I usually size up one or two sizes, so that the garment isn't very tight on my body. If I wear ""my size"" it tends to rasp and pull at my skin. No thank you.\n5. I realize people tend to buy 'whatever' for socks, but get good socks. I like Sockwell, Icebreaker, Point 6 and Smartwool. However, be aware that they have been upping the poly content in their socks, and the nylon content, so LOOK at the content of the socks, not just the brand. This is especially important if you have psorasis on your feet. \n6. Also pay good attention to your underwear and bras' materials. Bras and decorative/shaper underwear is often trimmed in poly lace which will be irritating. Silk underwear is amazing if you have patches in or around that area. I don't, I can get away with plain ol' knit cotton underwear, but I have had issues with that area in the past, and silk was a relief. It glides nicely. I haven't tried wool yet. I have tried a variety of other options, but they didn't work. Silk or bust, if things are bad down there.\n7. I have a strong preference for woven fabrics. (Button up shirts, twill jeans from 100% cotton, flannel shirts, that sort of thing. A good rule of thumb is that if the garment doesn't stretch, or if it does, but it says it is a stretch woven, then it's probably a woven material. Wikipedia this if you are really confused.) Again, I like my garments looser fitting. If you aren't into hippie/granola styles, you might work on becoming happy with them, because sharply tailored stuff is almost guaranteed to suck during a flare. During the worst flares, I want stuff that stays the heck away from my body.\n8. I've found that my skin does poorly with cheap metals, which includes the flies on jeans, buttons on pants, rivets on pants, some metalic-look threads in 'fancy' shirts, so on and so forth. I've transitioned to metal-free clothing. If you have issues with metals, this might be a choice for you.\n9. Some folks seem to have good luck with wearing an 'irritating' garment over a garment that doesn't bother them. This doesn't work for me for anything but either short wear times or several layers away (e.g. I'm wearing a polyester sweater, but it's three layers out), but it's a thing, and I think you should try it if you have a favorite piece that irritates you.\n10. This isn't clothes on you, but bedclothes should go by the same rules!\n11. Are shoes clothes? Suppose they are for the sake of this being thorough -- Shoes that breathe are awesome. Even if your feet and foot nails are awful, I recomend wearing a lightweight, sockless sandal as much as possible in warmer months. Remember, lotion and sunscreen before heading out!\n12. RIP OUT NECK TAGS. DOOOO IT. They are almost always made of cheaper, stiffer, awful fabric. If they aren't, they are often a polyester. Just take them out. If you need to keep them for some reason, sew them back into the side seam where, when worn, they won't touch your skin.\n13. I find lace to be irritating most of the time. It doesn't matter how nice it is, how soft. It sucks. I don't know why. You may also have this issue. \n14. Men, things will be harder for you in this regard, but style around a painful patch. Got knee patches? Don't wear pants styled with seam under the knee. Patches on wrist? Dont' wear tight cuffs. \n15. While I believe in phototherapy, I like to control my exposure and limit it to perhaps 15 minutes a day. I feel that wearing clothing over patches is protective in most scenarios, as it prevents rubbing/rasping/snagging of scales. \n16. If something causes you to flare up, get rid of it and don't get sucked in again. Figure out what works and STICK to your guns.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/u3z4fz/thoughts_from_a_longtimer_part_3_clothes/
u3yc3i,1649991517,Thoughts from a Long Timer Part 2: Hands and Feet,"Hi! I've had Psoriasis symptoms since I was 4, diagnosed at 8, and am now in my late 30s. I've also had Psoriatic Arthritis since I was 11. I'm writing a series about managing Psoriasis via lifestyle changes -- either to manage without meds if you find them intolerable, or to bolster a medication routine that isn't quite getting the job done. You can read part one here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/u2j1ej/thoughts\_from\_an\_longtimer\_part\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/u2j1ej/thoughts_from_an_longtimer_part_i/)\n\nI thought I would talk about clothing next, but I realized that the next best place to see rapid gains is hand and foot care. Please read part one first, as it does relate to this. Personally I get a lot of cuticle symptoms -- raggedy, peeling, splitting, bleeding, flaking. My hands often look chewed up. Compounding this, I have old frost nip damage which means in the winter, my hands can be awful. I used to have a lot of nail problems, but they cleared up one year and haven't really come back. My feet have similar issues, but the nails are affected. Psoriasis nails can look a lot like fungus nails. If you've been treating for fungus, and nothing is happening, it might be our dear ol' friend Psoriasis instead.\n\nThese are my ideas specific to hands and feet:\n\n1. My biggest problem with my hands and feet is actually triggered by food, but I want to address that in another post, so I'm not going to go into it here. I'm trying to stay very specific in this post.\n2. My second biggest problem with my hands and feet is temperature/humidity/barometric pressure changes. For the longest time, this looked like I was screwing up my lotion -- too much on the feet, and never, ever enough on my hands. But a few years ago I finally figured out that I really need to be careful with dramatic temperature/humidity/pressure changes. This can take a lot of forms:\n   1. In the winter, I err on the side of too warm. I'm basically the first person in town to start wearing gloves, and the last person to leave them off. Socks are the first thing I put on and the last thing I take off. \n   2. Even in summer, if I'm working early in the morning when it's still chilly, I'll wear gloves and heavy socks. \n   3. To that end, I try to have quite the collection of gloves and socks that can be exactly calibrated to the temperatures of the day. But more on this in my post on clothes.\n   4. If I've forgotten gloves, I go back and get them. If the gloves I have are wrong for the event, I go back and get something else. I don't just put up with cold hands. It will cause days or weeks of misery. I'm pretty pedantic about this. And I carry spares on me should my main gloves get wet or something.\n   5. I find it helpful to put lotion on before I put on gloves to go outside. I like something thick and pasty for this.\n   6. This is moreso true in summer than winter, but I schedule outside events when it is mild outside. I have a dog so I've been able to dial in what sort of combinations I can work with -- for example, in the winter, 20f degrees, no humidity, high pressure, I'm good to go. 20 degrees, high humidity (it's a thing, really) and low pressure? Eeeeeeeeh, time to stay inside and have a pig ear and a movie, instead of walk.  In summer, I do very, very poorly in high heat and humidity, so I go out near/just after sundown or early morning.  Low pressure effects me less in summer. I don't know why.\n   7. I'd like to say I avoid big altitude swings, but I actually love being up in the mountains and also I fly little planes, so honestly, if I know I'm going to be doing by altitude changes, I just take anti-inflammatories, and that seems to keep the weird effects at bay. If I still feel like a swollen little overripe berry when I transition from high altitude to low altitude, I drink half a diet coke, as the diuretic effect works for me. But that does trigger my scaly knuckles to dry out to. You win some you lose some.\n   8. If the weather is just nuts, I don't bathe, I don't shower. I slather on some lotion, try to keep it easy, and modulate my body temperature as much as I can. \n3. I add a little anti-fungal cream to the lotion I use on my hands and feet everyday. For some reason, this has really cut down on how often my hands and feet decide to crack and bleed. I've tried cuticle oils and specialty lotions, but they don't work as well. That said, the jury is out on ""Working Feet"" I can't decide if I like it or not. I'm also not sure about Bag Balm/Vermont Farmer. They changed up what is in it and I dont' think it works nearly as well.\n4. Carmex! It's a lip balm, but I rub carmex into my messed up cuticles/knuckles and it really helps. I'd like to find a more environmentally-friendly product, but this works for me. Burt's Bees OLD hand goo worked well albeit not as well. I haven't tried the new stuff that doesn't come in a tin.\n5. This is specific to feet -- while I do keep my feet warm in socks, I try to keep them out of shoes as much as possible. \n6. Let's talk about rubber gloves and rubber boots. With Psoriasis, I find that if my hands and feet get and stay wet, I have all kinds of horrible problems.  So I prevent them from getting wet by using these tools. Or, if I have a dirty job to do, I wear latex/rubber gloves and wash the gloves instead of my hands, as needed, so that I'm not washing and irritating my hands all day. Get a good fit on your latex gloves and you don't lose a lot of dexterity. Also, you can moisturize before putting these gloves on though it does complicate things. Get used to it, and it really helps. Especially if you are using harsh chemicals/petrochemicals.\n7. I try not to be hardcore about products, but I don't like a lot of the handwashing soaps out there. Too drying! I like bar soap. Just warm water and bar soap. Or maybe a little Dawn dishsoap if I feel like I'm really grody. \n8. Again, I try not to be hardcore about products because I feel like too often psoriasis suffers get policed on using anything that isn't 'medical grade' but I would say while using scented lotion once a day or so is fine, using it all day every day on your hands seems to worsen things. I would suggest having a scent-free lotion you use after washing your hands, for your hands.\n9. Hand sanitizer does awful things to my hands. 0/10 don't recommend. If you need that sort of product in your life, I'd recommend you run around with a little dish soap in a container, a water bottle, and a quick-drying bandana and really washing your hands instead of applying drying alcohol. If you must use it (job requirement) follow it up with diaper rash cream. Really. Or ask if you can have disposable gloves. \n10. Short nails seem to work best, but the trouble with having psoriasis is that our nails can cut very raggedly. If you find this is true, I suggest FILING not clipping them down. \n11. If your cuticles are really bad, and I mean bleeding, chafed, red, shiny, awful, tape or bandage them if you can't take a day off/glove up. When you get done with the day, consider slathering them in a heavy-duty moisturizer (honestly, I like Crisco for this) stuffing them in gloves or socks, and them warming them up. You don't want to sweat, just be a little TOO warm. 15-20 minutes of this can be a huge relief.\n12. Wash your hands/feet before slathering them in lotion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/u3yc3i/thoughts_from_a_long_timer_part_2_hands_and_feet/

u2j1ej,1649827628,Thoughts from an Longtimer -- Part I,"I've been thinking about how so many people here are new to Psorasis, or have been diagnosed in the  last few years, since the advent of biologics. It seems like some of the old methods of treating this disease have gone by the wayside. While that isn't all bad, its not all good either. Proper non-invasive treatments can reduce the need for biologics, which are harmful,  long term steriods, which are harmful, or just make you more comfortable during waiting, breakthrough flares, or medication switchovers.\n\nI've had psorasis for over 30 years -- while it has calmed down and no longer effects me as it did, I've experienced it on my scalp, hands, in my nail beds, on my feet, legs, and on my face. It affects my ears as well. I'm not a good candidate for most biologics, and frankly, didn't even much consider them until this year since my home-brewed treatment methods really have cut my troubles down to a manageable size.\n\nWhat I want to talk about first is bathing/moisturizing, because I think there is so much bad information out there about bathing/skin care and psoriasis. Also, it's something you probably do everyday (more on that in a moment) and so represents a good place to effect immediate positive change.\n\n1. Unless you are sweaty, grimy, sticky, stinky, or otherwise gross, don't bathe/shower everyday. Try every other day. There are a lot of theories as to why this works, but none of them hold up to close scrutiny, to be totally transparent. \n2. If you must bathe, consider adding a cup of salt to the bath, and a cup of vinegar. It doesn't seem to cause nearly the amount of drying that a normal bath does when these are added.\n3. I know that the prevailing wisdom is don't use scented/fancy bath or skin products, but in my experience, scents are fine, it's that you want to avoid cheap/aggressive products. Unless something actively seems to bother you, I think you can go ahead and use it.  (Caveat, I've always had issues with liquid body washes.)\n4. I don't recommend anti-dandruff shampoos. They smell, they can burn, they are hell if you get them in your eye, I think they give you dead, dry hair, they don't seem to have any positive impact on psoriasis, they cost too much, and did I mention they SMELL? \n5. I've had a lot of luck with ""hippie"" soaps and shampoos. The fewer ingredients, and the more you can pronounce, the better, in my experience. I currently use good quality bar soaps and a bar shampoo made by JRLiggets. I have previously had good luck with tea tree oil shampoos and argan oil conditioners. \n6. I know that over the years we've been told to not descale our skin, but it seems that the winds have changed and they want us to do so now. I've found that giving my scaly patches a hardcore scrub once or twice a week does much to relieve itching, flaking, burning, etc. I would select the roughest exfoliator you can tolerate.  You can get a scalp scrubber for your scalp, and I love mine. I prefer to exfoliate everything -- scalp, patches, the rest of my body.\n7. I have tested hot showers, lukewarm showers, hot showers followed by a cold blast, and every combo people say is good for the skin. I personally think a hot shower, and then stepping into a nice, warm room works the best for making sure your body benefits from the next step:\n8. Slap on heavy duty lotion immediately after giving yourself a toweling off. Hit the patches first. The worse the flare, the thicker and more paste-like the lotion should be. Sometimes you need to layer up products. When things are very bad, I slather my whole body in a lotion containing a minimum of hydrocortisone, and then slather on a layer of Eucerin (dead dinosaur juice offender #1.) When things are calmer, I use much more environmentally friendly products. I like olive oil and argan oil products, but shea butter and cocoa butter are nice as well.  If you are utterly opposed to dead dinosaur juice, Crisco is an option, but be aware it interacts poorly with acne and I only recommend it for scaly spots and nearby. \n9. If you are descaling your scalp, follow up with leaving a conditioner in for 5-10 minutes before rinising, a hot oil treatment, or other similar way of moisturizing your scalp. \n10. Do not descale if you can't follow up with a good moisturizer. Don't. It will feel amazing in the shower and horrible an hour later. \n11. Heavy duty moisturizers can stain clothing, so let it dry, buff it slightly, then get dressed.\n12. Personally, I think prescription-strength topical steroid creams make things worse. They thin out the skin, meaning it bleeds more easily when it scales and cracks. If things are really, really bad, I recommend slathering on lotion, olive oil, crisco, or coconut oil, letting it soften up the scales for an hour or so, and then gently descaling the area and showering and  reapplying the moisturizer of choice, or just reapplying. When I had really bad patches on my knees this winter, I reapplying lotion 5-7x a day and in about two days, the pain was nearly gone and the patches looked so much better.\n13. While shaving an affected area never seemed to have any impact either way, shaving non-affected areas has caused a sense of the psoriasis moving into that area that could sometimes last weeks. I would test this on yourself -- if in doubt, remain hairy.\n\nI want to talk about clothing and bedding, food, and some lifestyle things I've learned -- what would be a most interesting follow up for you guys?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/u2j1ej/thoughts_from_an_longtimer_part_i/

I was in my final year of uni and my mental health took a real turn (I'd already been having problems with uni because I had to take time out because my psoriasis and the treatments for it meant I literally could not work for a bit). My uni was useless in helping and didn't give me any real support and really made things a lot worse, adding loads of stress and sending my mental health spiraling. I tried to get mental health support from the NHS (I'm in the UK) but was put on a waiting list for about a year. Then... the pandemic hit. I was stuck inside trying to deal with my uni (which basically shut down during the pandemic, and again gave no support whilst i was in the midst of a dissertation), and long story short I ballooned in weight again, about another 20lb during the pandemic. I did try to exercise and keep active, but I think it all was just a toxic mix and it all got on top of me. Later in 2020 and 2021 my nightmare happened and I started getting more stretchmarks, on my breasts, back legs, hips and stomach. This KILLED me, I desperately wanted to avoid this but then it happened. That's where I am now, basically covered in them. I'm trying to work on treating them (bio oil, retinol creams and all that!) and also accepting them (I know they're natural and that loads of people have them), but I think I just find how much my body changed during this period and how much I feel let down really upsetting?

When I get stressed or depressed it comes back very badly. Like the one I am having now. I have it on my scalp(40%), Back(70%), Chest and abdomen(20%) and Thighs and legs(30%).\n\nI live with my parents and my parents are very worried since the flare up I have now is worse than what I have had before. I got to know from my sister that one day when I wasn't around my mom was crying about my condition to my dad. I mostly in front of my parents act like I don't care about my condition just so that they won't be worried. But internally I am depressed only. I have this habit of picking my skin from affected areas and put it near where I am sitting and cleaning them up myself before anyone else could. Today I was deep into a movie and forgot I put these on the floor. And my sister saw these and cleaned them up which made me very upset. \n\nEarlier when I was in my college hostel my friends used to see the flareups on my arm and ask me what it was. I used to tell them I was not sure, it could be because of some water problem since I have sensitive skin. I have noticed random people look at my flareups on my arm while I am out which makes me feel very uncomfortable. \n\nI have stopped my dairy intake and am planning to stop my sugar and fried food intake next. This is what helped me last time. I might try to stop my non-veg food as well idk yet. I just use a cream on the affected areas of my skin. I don't wanna take any medications since I saw they work by suppressing our immune system. Earlier I used to take some medicines which used to give me stomach burn. \n\nI just wanna get out of this situation soon somehow. I don't discuss this with anyone in my real life so I felt like getting it all out here. If there is anything that helped you guys let me know.

I wanted to share what i am experiencing incase someone may have some ideas of what's going on!\n\nTLDR: I have psoriasis patches on my palms and fingers and elbows. For some reason my arms and legs are constantly itchy as hell even tho I don't have any psoriasis patches on them. My derm has prescribed me two different antihistamines, thinking it was a result of extra histamine in my system because of my psoriasis flaring, however, neither have taken the itchyness away. \n\nSo I started having very mild psoriasis patches in December 2019. They were on the backs of my hands, in the corners of my eyes and on my elbows. They went away on their own, but I went to the doctor and showed him pictures afterward and he prescribed me a steroid cream thinking it was eczema. Over the course of 2020 my hands were on and off with patches of bumpy itchy skin. Then in 2021 a patch started forming on my right palm that has never gone away since. It kept growing and a short time later one started on my other palm. I still get small patches on my elbows but they are fairly easy to treat, and I also have some mild patches on my scalp. My hand are definitely the worst with alot of plaques and cracking itchy skin. \n\nIn October of 2021 I had a mosquito bite on my leg that I had started itching. For weeks it was itchy and I thought it seemed odd that it persisted so long and seemed to be sprrading, so I went back to my family doctor again and he finally referred me to a Derm. By the time I saw the derm both of my legs were extremely itchy, and I was scratching them pretty aggressively a few times a day. My derm thought it was a result of extra histamine in my system because of all the untreated psoriasis flaring on my hands. He gave me some creams for my hands and some extra strength reactin. The creams do help but I have never got my hands back to normal. However, since that time my arms and shoulders also started getting really itchy. I was trying really hard not to scratch my legs cause they were in rough shape, but I did start scratching my arms. When I went back to the derm he was puzzled as to why my skin was still itchy elsewhere. He gave me an antihistamine called rupall to try, and I've been on it for over a month and still itchy.\n\nI moisturize with aveeno everytime I shower and my skin looks normal, except for scabs from my scratching. Sometimes when I itch the skin gets bumpy in that area. \n\nDoes anyone have any ideas why I might be experiencing this itchyness? Has anyone experienced something similar? \n\nSide note: I'll also take any and all tips on managing my palms. What creams in what order and at what frequency works best?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/u048w2/very_itchy_skin/

As such, I’ve finished all the tests and am in the process for approval for Humira. \n\nMy question is regarding being sick, as from what my dermatologist indicated it lowers my immune system and effectively can make me sick more often as well as potentially a worse sickness, like upper respiratory infections, etc, and can then in turn make the drug less effective as I’d have to come off of.\n\nRight now, I have a one year old, and I’ve had more colds, stomach bugs, etc this year than in the last 31. Should I wait to my son gets older and sick less often or start Humira and take the chance?

tw6a7e,1649089773,Male recently diagnosed with genital psoriasis. Have some questions about how symptoms and how they come and go,"A bit of background: I had psoriasis for a long time (several years) near my anus that I never got diagnosed. It's dumb, but I was embarrassed to talk to a doctor about it. I also have had a lot of GI issues in my life so always thought it was possibly just related to the frequency with which I was going to the bathroom or something like that. Then, right before the start of the new year, I had some mild itching near the base of my penis along with some redness, and my entire scrotum was red. A couple clinic doctors thought it might be a yeast thing, but after a month and a half of anti-fungal treatments didn't really change anything, I saw a derm. Derm took a look at the scrotum rash as well as the ones on my backside and pretty quickly thought it was genital psoriasis. Didn't biopsy, but said the location of some on my backside were typical of psoriasis, and we talked about how I have some joint pain that could be related. He prescribed a topical steroid saying it wasn't a long term solution but was okay for use on the genitals for a short time to see how it cleared things up, and that we could discuss other options if necessary. The steroid brought the redness down, and my most severe itching episodes seem to have been treated as well. I've continued to use vaseline on the area since, which my derm said should help prevent things flaring up.\n\nWhat remains is mild enough that I'm not super concerned about treating, but just wanted to reach out to the community here to get a sense of how normal it is.\n\nThe rash I started out with looks way better than it used to, and most of the time it looks totally clear. Although sometimes it seems to become noticeable again, although much lighter than it used to be. Additionally, the area below my belly button down to my pubic area sometimes has a faint itchiness to it. Most of the time the skin here looks normal (no rash), although sometimes I do see a very faint rash. This seems to come and go throughout the day. Is this normal? Does itchiness without redness ever occur? To be honest, I feel like since being told I have psoriasis, I'm just way more sensitive to any itching on my body, because my first thought is that something is about to flair up there. So maybe I'm overreacting to normal itching. This is all mild enough that I'm not very concerned about it. Just curious if it's related.\n\nThe other main symptom I have is not an itchiness but I guess what I would describe as a feeling of scabbing. I don't have plaques that are dry and scaly or anything, so it's not like the skin is actually scabby. I just sort of get the sensation of tight skin being pulled in similar to scabbing, or maybe when a severe sunburn is healing, although much less painful. This occurs more in my perineum area. Is it normal for psoriasis, particularly in this region, to have these different types of sensations? I feel like I have different areas in the genital region that my symptoms always tend to appear in, like they're pretty localized to very specific spots, but each spot has a different sensation associated with it. Does psoriasis present this way?\n\nThanks everyone. I'm very relieved to have been given something by a doctor that has helped a lot, but am just trying to sort through these very mild lingering symptoms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/tw6a7e/male_recently_diagnosed_with_genital_psoriasis/
