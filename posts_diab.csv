uejt2n,1651231801,Dropped HbA1c from 6.1 to 5.7 in 2 months by diet modifcation.,"Hello. In the beginning of April a random HbA1c showed me prediabetic at 6.1. I was (still am) obese at 88 kgs. After that, for a few days, I tried to walk daily for atleast an hour which was unsustainable. What I did differently was completely quit the sugar milk tea which we drink often here. Rice is also the staple in my locality. My household eats rice twice a day, sometimes thrice. I totally cut off rice. I started eating more of veggies and sometimes, eggs and chicken. Rice was replaced by roti (round flatbread native to the Indian subcontinent made from whole wheat flour). That is it. That is all I did. I lost 8 kgs in 2 months and am now at 80 kgs. \n\nI checked my HbA1c yesterday. Surprisingly, it was 5.7.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/uejt2n/dropped_hba1c_from_61_to_57_in_2_months_by_diet/

My Physician won't believe me.,"I(20M) got my blood test results a few days ago and my fasting blood sugar came out to be 115 mg/dL; HbA1C came out to be 5.0. I don't eat sugar. AT ALL. No colas, no sweets, not even in my coffee. I have been trying to lose weight, so I have cut down on sugar and have been following intermittent fasting (16:8) since January. I also work out for about 1 hour every day. The last time I checked my blood sugar was in September 2021 and back then even though I was eating ridiculous amounts of sugar, my blood sugar was normal. It's confusing. I told my physician and he didn't believe me and told me to work out more and stop eating sugars. What could be causing this?\n\nEdit: I have also cut down a lot on my carbs.

Also there was no other sign of diabetes on my results, and all my other blood work was fine. She ran other tests and a c-peptide. She was also worried I had a bit high bilirubin at 2.5 but my research points me to not worrying about it - might just be Gilbert's Syndrome. \n\nTo take this even further, she made me get a upper right abdominal ultrasound to check out all my organs like my pancrease, liver, and kidneys and it all came out great.

However, I can't get over how awful it is to use the dexcom app. \n\nBefore dexcom I was using mysugr to track finger sticks. It was easy to log several different things in one entry, and I could even take notes. I was surprised how basic the dexcom app is in comparison. \n\nI guess I can learn to live with all that, but the alerts from dexcom are driving me insane. The developers don't seem to realize that it takes some time to come down from a high, or come back up from a low. When I get an alert I'll take the appropriate action to correct my sugar, but dexcom will continue to scream at me until it is back to normal. I tried to change the alert sounds, but they are all extremely disruptive. I wish there was a snooze button, a way to say ""I'm aware my BG is high. I've taken my insulin, give it time to work before you blast me again."" They only options I have are to disable all device notifications or set the alarm thresholds way out of wack and hope that I remember to reset them later\n\nIn the alert settings I see rise/fall rate, and high/low soon, but they have never sounded for me.\n\nI tried to keep this from sounding like a rant, but surely I'm not the only one that feels this way, right?

ucwkzv,1651038912,"Let’s talk about GLPs and T1Ds (Victoza, Trulicity, Ozempic)","GLPs, or glucagon-like peptides are often used to treat type-2 diabetes. You might recognize the drug brands like Victoza (liraglutide), Trulicity (dualaglutude) and Ozempic (semaglutide).\n\nMore and more these days, endos are becoming comfortable with prescribing GLPs off-label for T1Ds. While not officially approved for T1D, research is showing some promising results and individuals are reporting it as well. \n\nI’ve used all three of the major GLPs over the course of the last several years and would like to share my personal experience and would love to hear the experiences of other T1Ds as well. \n\nBroadly speaking, GLPs regulate things like satiety, gastric emptying rate, ISF / IC (except for Ozempic), and inhibit glucagon production (Ozempic only).\n\nNeedless to say, this is not medical advice. It’s anecdotal. Consult your endo. \n\nHere’s my experience with the three major GLPs (YDMV). Would love to hear others. \n\nAll 3 GLPs:\n——————\nPros:\n- some weight loss\n- reduction in post-prandial highs\n- slower gastric emptying \n- increased time in range\n- reduction in avg glucose\nCons:\n- gastric discomfort (indigestion / heartburn) \n- occasional severe nausea\n- rare vomiting\n\nVictoza\n——————\nPros: \n- strongest ISF/IC changes\n- moderate weight loss\n- significant satiety changes\nCons:\n- daily injections\n- reductions in insulin dosing can be a little tricky during onboarding\n\nTrulicity\n——————\nPros: \n- very minor weight loss\n- minor satiety changes\n- weekly injections\nCons:\n- nominal ISF/IC changes\n- feels “weakest” of the three\n\nOzempic\n——————\nPros: \n- minor weight loss\n- minor satiety changes\n- weekly injections\nCons:\n- loses effectiveness over time (needs increases in dosing)\n- no impact on ISF/IC\n\nAfter trying all three, my preferred GLP is Victoza. The biggest drawback of Victoza is daily injections and, like all three, the gastric discomfort. But the benefits outweigh the downsides. \n\nTo put the benefits in perspective, with Victoza I saw a 14% increase in time-in-range with only a 1% increase in lows and I lost about 10lbs. That’s pretty darn impressive and why I’m sticking with it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/ucwkzv/lets_talk_about_glps_and_t1ds_victoza_trulicity/

I can't physically make my hand push the pen to contact, and that lack of control seems separate from my mood, then the anxiety builds rapidly. \n\nIt's almost cartoon-ish watching myself get more and more drastic in initiating the injection movement and bam - stops a quarter of an inch from my skin every time.\n\nI've tried a lot of things, even if they seemed unrelated.

He uses a Dexcom to monitor his blood sugar. We pay out the wazoo for a premium insurance plan with Anthem because both of us have significant health issues. \n\nHe learned today via the Anthem claims portal that we owe $3000 for his recent Dexcom order via US Med (medical supplier). We hadn't been paying anything up to this point for them (other than the high monthly premiums to Anthem), as it was covered in our plan as a durable medical device. \n\nWell, apparently a few months ago, Anthem decided to change their coverage policy for CGMs (constant glucose monitors). They will now no longer be included in medical coverage but under pharmacy 'benefits.' Apparently, Anthem informed us of this change some time in January via hard copy letter (which we never received). We received no other notifications about this change, no emails, nothing. As such, a we received a normal delivery of CGMs a couple of weeks ago and thought nothing of it, as we weren't aware of any policy changes. \n\nFast forward to a couple of days ago, he needs to put on a new device, and that's when he happened look at his claims on Anthem, and we discovered the $3k charge. My husband is currently without a CGM on because we are afraid to open the box and be charged the $3000 for it, which is a significant amount of money for us. We are beyond the thirty days to return it to the medical supplier. So, we are in limbo. And Anthem is running us around their phone tree this morning, even connecting him to a fax line at one point. He's going to have to take off the whole day to deal with this administrative issue.\n\nOn top of all this, we are likely going to have to pay $200-300 a month now for diabetes supplies where we were not before. We asked Anthem for the actual cost, and ""they couldn't tell us yet."" \n\nApparently, CGMs are being pushed/marketed towards T2Ds (which is great!), but it feels like Anthem is changing its coverage because they are having to spend so much covering ALL diabetics. This is educated speculation, but it feels on point for how shitty these insurance companies truly are.\n\nI hate this. It's wrong. I can't imagine if we were in a less privileged position (mind you, we're only middle class). I feel awful for the elderly folks and less educated people that have to navigate this system. Or those that can barely function on a day-to-day basis due to their illness. They just die I guess. This kind of thing is so fucked up and makes me want to run for political office.

I am a college student and back in October I went in to the doctor for some routine blood work. I got a call at 8pm that night from a worried lab tech. She asked if I was okay as they just got my blood sugar level back and it was at 35. My dad has type 1 diabetes and I knew that wasn’t good, but I also knew I wasn’t showing any symptoms. I had gone about my day, driving myself to and from that doctors appointment. I ended up getting a monitor to check throughout the day until I went home for Christmas break. While home I went to the doctor for my knee(unrelated) and mentioned the previous low. She got me a prescription for a libre, just in case. That’s when I started to recognize the pattern. I was dipping to 40 or below almost every night, as well as below 50 throughout the day. The only continuous factor was the lows at night. I am also constantly thirsty/peeing and can not focus for the life of me. I have gone down 3 pant sizes since January. The strange thing is I am not getting any highs. I haven’t seen my blood sugar go past 200. I ended up staying home for the semester for my knee surgery. I saw an endocrinologist in the mean time and she checked me for addisons and some other things. She recommended I stop using the libre because it seemed inaccurate from when they had done lab work, so I did. Then I went in for knee surgery last week. Right before I was put on anesthesia they asked if there were any medical conditions they should be aware of sort of a “last call”. My mom piped up and mentioned my blood sugars. I was feeling fine and kind of annoyed, dismissing her as the endocrinologist said I was fine to have surgery. They said they need to check my sugar before they proceed and use a monitor(the hospital's) the first time it reads as lo. the nurse said she had never seen ut do that. then it reads at 28. they start to get frantic, rushing around to get dextrose, finding my surgeon, etc. Meanwhile Im chilling.

uanllh,1650777941,Gotta love siblings,"I guess I’ve gone through the rite of passage. Just put my cgm by myself. I always needed help(I just get worried that my shaky hands will mess up the insertion, but no problems!) My sister was super grossed out by me asking for help(my mom usually helps me put it but she’s gone atm), so I just up and did it myself. Went upstairs to tell her I put the sensor in, and then asked what she’s gonna do if she’s positive for the antibody. I’m 1.5, and was positive for one of the antibodies, so my parents sent out both my siblings’ blood samples to get tested. I just asked what she’s going to do if she’s positive, as she is really freaked out by needles(obviously I would help her if it came down to it, but she’s leaving soon so I wouldn’t always be there), and she immediately goes “You act like you want me to get it.” I have never said anything about ever wanting her to be positive for the antibody. I have only made a joke and told her “Don’t eat too much sugar” Because I get stuff like that(my mom was super pissed, but I apologised for a joke in poor taste, despite my mom knowing that’s not how the beetus works). I would never, ever wish diabetes on someone. But it’s just alienating and hurtful for her to be so disgusted by my disease. I get that she doesn’t like needles and it’s (probably) not because the beetus itself, but it still feels cruddy. She immediately shut me down when I told her that I wouldn’t ever want her to have it, saying she didn’t want to talk about it. I get that, but I’m worried about what will happen if she is positive. Diabetes is on both sides of my family, and I am praying to all the gods that neither of my siblings are positive, but I’m worried about how she’ll react if she is actually positive. I’m scared she won’t take care of herself when she goes off to college. Any advice on helping with anxiety over these things?",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/uanllh/gotta_love_siblings/

Even the insulin (he's on 3 separate kinds of medications) does nothing. These infections, even when they seem mild, drag on for weeks, during which time he still eating low carb and working out and taking all his medicines and his blood sugar is spiking above 400. He sees his endocrinologist every 2 months and every time he goes in his A1c is still ridiculously high. I get the feeling that she doesn't really believe he is putting in the effort that he is.

I had an A1C of 12.3%, an average glucose of 306 ml/dl, and weighed in at 225lbs. My doctor immediately prescribed me 4x 500mg metformin daily and strongly suggested a reduced carbohydrate diet.

Within that amount of time I have had a total of 3 cheat days but even the cheat days don’t go over 125 carbs. Normally on cheat day I notice my blood sugar will spike considerably.

Before I start this I want to say, it's not necessarily about the people who post it, it's about the people who comment. \n\nSo I'll see these posts on Instagram about people making food. For example one day I saw a skinny woman **(this is important)**, making these things, it was nutella on bread and [fried? toasted?] in a pan. People commenting saying things like ""that looks so good!"" Or another, the people who eat on YouTube, they always seem to be eating sugary things and stuff like that. \n\nBut when an overweight woman posts herself making food, lets say she made the same thing the skinny woman made, she would get comments saying ""no wonder you're overweight"" &amp; diabetic comments. \n\n\nI've been dieting all my life, working out 3-5 days a week, try not to eat too much sugary stuff. I feel awful seeing the hypocrisy of how people treat others **(not just women)** based on their weight/how they look. It makes me feel bad also because I think I'm doing something wrong because I try so hard, and yet I still dont look like them. Why can they eat that and be praised, but then I'll eat that same thing and be told ""are you really gonna eat that?"" &amp; ""You're going back for more?"" \n\nLife sucks. People suck.\n\nAnd again, it's not about the people who post it, it's about the people who comment.

The only relief I had was taking a really hot shower. I would often take about 7 showers a night and because of that, I averaged about 3 hours of sleep each night for about 10 months straight. Don't know how I managed to function in my job as a mechanic, but by some chance i was able to. \n\nI've tried pretty much every medicine that's available that's supposed to help the nerve pain. Some did help for a time, and moat were absolutely useless and offered no relief. So my only option for years was narcotics. Most recently I've been on a 50mcg Fentanyl Patch changed every 48 hours, and x4 15mg Ocycodone/day, and those still barely work. \n\nMu nerve pain now isn't so much a describable type of pain the way most doctors would ask. It's more of a sensory overload. Like I'm constantly aware of every nerve from the waist down and they are constantly misfiring. That's the best way I can describe it, and all I can say is I wouldn't wish this on anyone. It's completely taken I've my life and I am stuck in my bed almost all day, every day. Lying down at least let's me be somewhat comfortable and helps with the restrictive blood flow to my legs. \n\nI would appreciate anyone's suggestions or advice as I recently moved from SC to IN and the doctors here are all assholes who aren't interested in doing their job as they can order tons of pointless tests and monthly cortisol injections as I am a diabetic and I've already had several nerve conduction studies that show I have extremely severe nerve damage and it is irreversible so it can only get worse. \n\nThank you in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/u9yk0w/peripheral_neuropathy/

Due to financial struggles, he’s been unable to see an endo since his initial diagnosis’s and get him the adequate insulin/dosages.

I am 4 months postpartum and had gestational diabetes that required insulin for fasting numbers. Since giving birth everyone said “you’ll go back to normal” but I haven’t. My fasting is a good normal 85-111 depending on the quality of sleep I get. But my after meal numbers are occasionally a little high, usually at dinner time (160-207). I suspect a couple things: reactive hypoglycemia and that the higher numbers are following a low I either knew about or didn’t. I believe my A1C will come back normal due to the lows and the fact that the spikes don’t last too long. Anyone experience this? Anyone have gestational and then slowly turn type 2? The lows happen a couple hours after eating which is why I think reactive hypoglycemia. \n\nToday for my glucose test I tested at 1 hour and it was 216, my 2 hour was 144 so not diabetes I don’t think.

About 6 months ago (iirc) after a blood test to see why I am always so low energy, it was discovered that I was on the line for being diabetic, their exact words (amongst other things but this was checked due to my mum's mum having diabetes).\n\nI was told to watch what I eat.... thank you bye....\nThat was all the doctor said to me.\n\nAbout 3 months ago, I chased up my doctor's and begged them to speak to a dietician or a diabetic specialist, explaining that I had absolutely no idea what was going on or what I should be doing. Googling things just got me so many different conflicting answers and felt like doom scrolling and that I didn't know what to believe, and reading subReddits, it's all a different language to me (I mean no offence I just don't understand the terms and how they relate to anything).\n\nThey refused to let me speak to either until I had had another blood test. I did this which took a month to even happen. They told me they would get back to me in 2-3 weeks max.\n\nFast forward to today (2 months after the blood test) I ring up to see why they haven't called me back about my results. She (receptionist) tells me my results are fine. I said what do you mean fine? She said according to the results you are fine. I said that doesn't mean anything to me because before, I was ""on the line"" for being diabetic, so am I now magically not prone to diabetes or have I still got to watch what I eat or what? I was told that I was fine, I am no longer on the line, I'm completely clear. I repeated that doesn't really help me at all. She asked if there was anything else I needed today, an begged her to let me speak to somebody now I'd had the blood tests. Reluctantly she said, after a few minutes of talking to someone else, they will have a ""diabetic nurse"" ringing me in the morning.\n\nAm I being stupid or were they not being very helpful, or just being akward/lazy. I've had 6 months where I don't know if I'm doing irreversible damage to myself, or worrying for nothing. I'm getting the impression that I was never on the line at all the way they made mistake or something. I expected them to throw information at me that I needed but they've done quite the opposite.\n\nMy mental health leads me to not be too worried about death, but I prefer it not to be long and painful, and more at my own discretion (But don't let that derail the conversation, it's not an issue) but living in this limbo just isn't helping with my mental health on general. I live in fear and confusion as if every bite of food is slowly killing me, or its all perfectly fine. \n\nI suppose what I'm asking is, is it normal for doctors to be so vague with you and not forthcoming with information or is this normal. I suppose this is aimed more at UK residents. Also, is there anything in particular I should ask this nurse in the morning that will trigger her to to give me the information I need, and am I right in thinking that if I was ""on the line for diabetes"" that I am still prone to being diabetic like logic would suggest.\n\nThanks.

u8o5cc,1650549124,Trulicity plus metformin … when is it appropriate to add in insulin?,"First time posting and this is on behalf of my dad (67, with an array of health issues, severe arthritis, mobility issues (needs cane, trouble with stairs), COPD, long term hypertension, heart attack survivor (2018), sleep problems, obesity, type 2 diabetes, some cognitive decline but living independently). His P/T attributes some of his mind fog, dry mouth, and regular bouts of “weakness” to diabetes. Yet he went to check in with his endocrinologist yesterday and no meds were changed. He wants to know whether there any other options in meds to treat what to him seems like his diabetes isn’t really under control. Is trulciity always kept so long as your body is producing some insulin? Is this standard protocol not to receive insulin unless your body stops producing it on its own? I think he has difficulty feeling heard in his appointments, so I’ll offer to attend the next one with him to advocate but I’m not sure if maybe we need another doctor or if this is standard and maybe it’s not diabetes that’s causing this but something else.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/u8o5cc/trulicity_plus_metformin_when_is_it_appropriate/
u8np75,1650547791,Monthly/yearly cost of insulin pump + supplies + CGM + insulin in Switzerland?,"Hello all,\n\nI'm considering a job opportunity in Zurich but I'm a bit afraid of the potential cost of diabetes.

u8izzb,1650530839,Can 10-12 days of higher carbohydrate intake significantly affect an HbA1c test?,"Hello,\n\nMy usual routine is:\n\n* 45 minutes of walking per day, 5 times a week\n* I try to control my carbohydrate intake on most days\n* I try to do 14-16 hours of intermittent fasting 3-4 days a week\n\nAbout 12 days back (9 April), I tested positive for COVID. Thus, I spent the next 10-12 days at home, and I also indulged in carbohydrates (e.g., too much rice) for about 10 of those days.\n\nThe only mitigating factor would be that I've been fasting for ~15 hours ***everyday*** (not intermittently as usual) for the last 2 and a half weeks.\n\nI'm going back to my usual routine, now.\n\n**I have an appointment to give a sample for HbA1c today. Would it be better to postpone it for a couple of weeks while I get back into my usual routine, or would it be better to go ahead today?**\n\nThank you for your time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/u8izzb/can_1012_days_of_higher_carbohydrate_intake/

u8fjy8,1650516486,Anyone else have this issue ?,So for the past couple days my blood sugar will not go down for the love of it even with me giving myself insulin. I was 300 the other night for over 2 hours and I have given myself insulin maybe 2-3 times within that frame and it just wasn’t dropping. I check my Admelog pen and it wasn’t expired. ( my Omni pods don’t come in for another week or so . That’s why I still have pens) I’m drinking water like crazy to drop it as well. And I’m just mad and frustrated as to why it won’t drop down. I’m waiting for my dr to call back cause magically every time I call it’s busy and they get back to me the next day.,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/u8fjy8/anyone_else_have_this_issue/
