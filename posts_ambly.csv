ucgnsq,1650990810,Hope I'm not too late,"My son is 10. When he was 5 we saw a specialist who recommended an MRI. I had shit insurance and got left holding the bag for a $10,000 MRI. The specialist recommended patching, which we did for about 4 months. \n\nI'm ashamed to say we didn't follow up. I couldn't afford insurance on top of paying off that debt. We did our best to ensure he kept his patch on in those 4 months but saw no improvement. I've helped him learn to shoot lefty, and that's his natural instinct now with nerf guns. He got a bow for Christmas from his uncle a few years back as well. \n\nMore recently, I have gotten to a point that I can afford insurance, and it actually pays out.  Luckily he is otherwise very healthy so we are caught up on checkups and dentistry. We took him in for an eye exam and got recommended to a specialist again today.\n\nI got him an occulus as well after reading that it could be helpful. \n\nAny advice is appreciated. This has been eating at me for years,  and i feel like I failed him, so i hope we can still find a way to help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Amblyopia/comments/ucgnsq/hope_im_not_too_late/

tgkehz,1647551398,Do I have Amblyopia?,"So I have pretty much always had a lazy eye. I remember as a child the doctor made me wear an eye patch on the ""good"" eye (right) to give the ""bad"" eye (left) rest, with the hope that it would make it correct itself. Obviously this was the wrong treatment, as I have read that you are supposed to patch the good eye to strengthen the bad eye. \n\nMy vision isn't great at all, I wear a +5.00 contacts in my right eye, and +6.00 in my left eye. Whenever I wear glasses/contacts, my lazy eye (left eye) is corrected (or at least 90% corrected, but that could be due to poor prescription). I always warn the optometrist of this, but they always try to give me the best vision rather than trying to find the strength that corrects the lazy eye. This is important to me because I rather have straight eyes than perfect vision. I also have astigmatism, if that matters.\n\nMy brain for sure favors my right eye. If I close my left eye, I don't really notice a change in my vision other than the loss of peripheral vision of what my left eye captures. However, if I make myself use the left eye as the ""dominant eye,"" my right eye's vision is basically peripheral, and this also causes my right eye to become lazy, as it drifts inward. And my left (normally lazy eye) will become straight. \n\nMy old optometrist retired so I went to a new optometrist today and told her that I had a lazy eye, and that she'd need to find the correct strength to prevent my eye from becoming lazy. And like normal, I go home and look in the mirror and see the new prescription is causing my lazy eye to drift in, and I feel a minor strain/pull. \n\nIf it matters, my vision is terrible but I am good at overfocusing and can even read without corrective lenses despite my high prescription if I overfocus. Overfocusing makes my eye drift farther inward though.\n\nI asked the optometrist if I could get Lasik since my vision is corrected with contacts/glasses, but she told me no. Her reason was they don't want to basically perform the surgery and have it drift during the procedure...but my eyes are perfectly straight if I use them individually, so that wouldn't happen as long as the opposite eye was closed/patched. I don't really feel like I have depth perception issues in sports and 3D, like some posts talk about on here, so I'm wondering if I was maybe misdiagnosed? \n\nSorry for the novel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Amblyopia/comments/tgkehz/do_i_have_amblyopia/

When i look at something close my eyes work together well, however when i look into the distance my left eye is straight but my right eye has an inwards turn towards my nose. When i cover my left eye my right eye will then become perfect but when i uncover my left eye it's turned inwards towards my nose. It keeps alternating like that however most of the times when i'm looking at something far my left eye is always straight. I don't know if i have acquired alternating estropia and would really like some clarification please. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Amblyopia/comments/t9d9en/unsure_what_my_problem_is/

I am now 21 and I am worried about the health of my eye. My left eye prescription, which is the one with exotropia, is at a -4.75 and my right is at a -2.5 with a fix for astigmatism. I noticed a few years ago that when I close and open each eye individually, my visual plane jumps. If I was to hold a finger up in front of a circle and close my left eye, it would stay still but when i do the same and close my right eye, the entire scene jumps. \n\nOver the past few weeks I‚Äôve just become aware that my right eye is the dominant one. I can almost feel that I‚Äôm primarily looking out of my right eye. I‚Äôm not sure if that even makes sense haha but it feels like my left eye is kind‚Äôve just along for the ride. I‚Äôm not experiencing double vision though and the only issue I‚Äôve ever noticed with depth perception is when it comes to parking my car.\n\nThe last optometrist I saw just a few months ago said I didn‚Äôt even have a strabismus, which just isn‚Äôt possible.

My partner got diagnosed with Amblyopia on her left eye during her college years and optometrist simply said it was no hope at the time(as most sources still saying) thus she‚Äôs been living with that thought ever since. Via this thread I now know vision therapy and practice can still shed some light and hope, and just wondering at age 28 is it at all possible to give those a try. Before, she had her left eye Ambli-ed and right eye crystal clear, however up until now the right eye is having some impairment too, latest diagnostic was sth like 5/10 vision.

It's impossible for me to make my amblyopic eye look anywhere else other then following the direction of my good eye. \n\nI have no vision therapist near me that thinks of amblyopia as something that can be fixed after adulthood, so I don't really have any place to turn to where I would get information that's useful. My thinking is that it's vital for me to gain control of my amblyopic eye so I can line it up with my  good eye. Otherwise I'm only going to gain double vision, which obviously doesn't help me, it only makes things more difficult. \n\nI recently downloaded an app, amblyo match, where you can calibrate deviation and then use 3d glasses to line up objects, this was very effective as I only after a couple of days started seeing double without trying to. lights are the easiest but also random objects that I've looked at, like faces. I stopped using the app because of my worry and because the double vision isn't pleasant.

I was very diligent about patching, and while I recovered a lot of vision in the affected eye, I never developed stereopsis, and I am able to read more lines with my good eye than my bad eye on a vision test.

phcjmq,1630698861,Looking for advise on vision therapy,"I have  had amblyopia affecting my right eye since I was a kid but I only found out about it as an adult. Around 8 years ago my optometrist told me that the reason for my double vision was amblyopia.  For several years I felt like my lazy eye did not effect my life much, I had poor coordination and depth perception but it did not interfere with my daily life. My optometrist told me that it would cost in excess of $5000 to go to vision therapy and take years so I did not think it was worth while to do anything about my lazy eye. \n\nThen around 4 years ago I started cycling and bike touring. As my love of biking grew I became more and more frustrated with the persistent double vision I experienced. I moved cities and found a new optometrist. It turned out their office offered vision therapy and even though I was reluctant to spend the money on it I decided to go to a consultation.\n\nThis is my experience so far and I would love some feedback and advice from anyone willing to give it!\n\nI met with my vision therapist for the first time in April, they said that the treatment they where suggesting would cost around $400-$800 and take 3 months to complete.  They were very optimistic that I would be able to improve my double vision and said they believed I could see results within a couple weeks with therapy. I was shocked by the short time frame and the low price tag and immediately decided it would be worth a shot. \n\nAs a side note, the same week I started vision therapy, by chance, was when I updated my prescription. \n\nThe program I used was a series of online exercises  from web[visiontherapy.co](https://visiontherapy.com)m done with red/blue glasses. My Therapist suggested doing the exercises for about 15 minutes a day but most days I tried to do more then that.  Over the first 3 weeks the exercises where nearly impossible.  It took a follow up appointment to realize that I was complete unable to coordinate my eyes enough to do them. \n\nAt this point my therapist introduced me to brock string exercises and suggested lowering my prescription.  The prescription change would take a couple weeks so I started working with the brock string. Immediately working with the brock string improved my eyes ability to focus together and the web based exercises became much easier. \n\nFor about 3-4 weeks I continued to see improvement. Then I received my new prescription, my therapist believed that lowering the prescription in my right eye would help with my lazy eye, and I noticed things start to get worse instead of better. \n\nAlthough I tried to continue with exercises for a few weeks after getting this new prescription I have not seen the improvement I saw before. In fact my double vision now is worse then ever and it feels more frustrating.  I decided to take a break from the exercises I  have been doing online but I don't know what to do next. My Vision therapist is really supportive but I feel like I need to try a different approach and I am wondering what other people have tried.\n\nTLDR;  I tried vision Web Vision Therapy and Brock String exercise but my double vision is worse then ever right now. What have other people tried? Does anyone else feel like their eyes are hopeless?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Amblyopia/comments/phcjmq/looking_for_advise_on_vision_therapy/

pfdpxn,1630440473,No treatment for 2 YO with Amblyopia?,"Apologies if posting in error - I'm not seeking medical advice, but anecdotal experience or correlating personal information would be appreciated. And, I suppose I am venting a bit. My son was a 34 week preemie. He had some expected drift in his left eye as an infant that seemed to correct (aesthetically anyhow, no pediatrician ever pointed it out and no issues with milestones ever caused concern). About 2 months ago, he seemingly suddenly started drifting heavily. He can ""snap"" focus back, but often drifts again shortly after. It doesn't appear to be affecting his stereoscopic vision much, but that's likely because he's only relying on his dominant eye I suppose. We saw a specialist a few weeks back, and after 3 hours of testing, the opthamologist said we're going to... do nothing. \n\nThere's some shock with this, because as a parent you want to do something, not nothing, and we're purusing a second opinion for our own peace of mind in that area. I can accept that doing nothing may be the best course of action here, but my own research on development from 0-7 years has me a little confused, especially in this area. It sounds like normal development doesn't really ""solidify"" until 3-5 years or later. The presentation from the opthamologist was that it might self correct as part of natural development. Everything I've read says this isn't generally the case (and it does seem to be getting worse over the past few weeks, not better, with longer and more frequent drifts). Is the fear here that treating while vision is still developing can make things worse? I hate to be so cynical, but the feeling is that the Dr. wants to see where the condition lands over time, so he knows how to treat from there, instead of attempting to treat from here, but I don't understand why he would want to do that. We don't even know what the cause of the amblyopia is, so how do you treat? Can you not diagnose for cause until vision is more fully developed or something? Other information presents the idea that prognosis improves greatly when treated ""early"". I get the sense ""early"" is a very specific metric in this case, since different types and parts of developments are occuring in different age ranges. \n\nAt any rate, any experience with amblyopia presenting with 0-2? How did things turn out over time? Any special support or action to take at home? Did you experience any recurrance or recidivism over time?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Amblyopia/comments/pfdpxn/no_treatment_for_2_yo_with_amblyopia/

This past year I've noticed that my bad eye's vision has been getting clearer than before then suddenly last week I started noticing that I'm having occasional double images and slightly blurry vision that's fixed by closing my bad eye. Could the problem be that my brain is no longer suppressing my bad eye and due to how the vision in my bad eye is worse than my good eye, my brain is having issues with converging them? I was wondering if this could be fixed without surgery with the help of vivid vision. Here's my recent prescription [I know it says 6/9 for both eyes but the vision chart the doctor was using had black spots over it due to a dirty projector(?) that made reading it hard.

oa374j,1624950737,"Please, I need advice urgently. Read thoroughly.","My case is quite peculiar:\n\nI wasn't born with amblyopia, my eyes were perfectly fine, they were perfectly aligned and my vision was fine. But, when I was 14-15 years old, my left eye caught a really bad viral conjunctivitis and I didn't stop it early enough, so there was some damage. The damage was, blurry vision and photosensitivity, and doctors told me I would have to experience the latter for an undefined period of time; it could be 1, 5 or 10 years. Heck, maybe the rest of my life.\n\nI was very confused about this, because what I was told was that my cornea got scratched and there was no medical shortcut or assistance to help me recover. It was all a matter of time. But here I am, 7 years later, having no indication of recovery whatsoever, but actually the opposite. It's getting worse. My left vision is as blurry and photosensitive (if not more) as it was back then. But there is more now: now my left eye has become lazy, and I still don't know why. I've developed strabismus, which I intuitively associate with the amblyopia I developed, as my brain stopped using my left eye for so long. I also think there has been some muscular damage for sure, which contributes to the long-term misalignment, seemingly exponential. It seems like it's getting worse everyday.\n\nI just feel hopeless. I know I should've and should visit a doctor, restlessly if I have to, but I happen to have depression and bad anxiety, and I've been prolonging this issue for months, even years. I did go to check my vision a year ago, but the doctor practically ignored me, the severity and the background of the issue. I also explained myself horribly because I'm very shy.\n\nThis has destroyed my social life. Since I started noticing it was getting worse, I've been extremely self-conscious, and now I can't go outside my house because of this. I look at my pictures of me todat and I don't recognize myself. It makes me cry. I ask you all to give me an advice, or if you have an idea of what could've happened and how could I treat and cure my left eye. I would do everything. I just want my eyes like they were before. For practical and aesthetic reasons. I hope you understand my pain. And before you say it, yes, I know I need to go to a doctor, but I just want advice from the public because the last ""professional"" that examined me, completely rejected/ignored my preoccupations. It must be a matter of finding a competitive professional. I want to know or have a better understanding of what could've caused this so I can address it properly, and fix this once for all.\n\nThank you for reading and sorry for the rant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Amblyopia/comments/oa374j/please_i_need_advice_urgently_read_thoroughly/

o93j9a,1624821161,Affordable VR Amblyopia Exercise using Beat Saber,"I just wanted to share with everyone how I add some gamification to my eye exercise.  I used to use an overlay app with SteamVR that let me mask one eye with a color of my choice and the opacity of my choice.  It hasn't worked in over a year after a SteamVR update.  \n\n\nI now use red/green glasses.  The flat kind designed to hang inside of glasses in front of the Lenses of an Oculus Quest.  I then use the custom colors in Beat Saber and adjust them so that only my Weak Eye can distinguish between the block colors.  Both eyes see the arrows which are not adjustable, but my strong eye only sees black blocks.  My weak eye has to discern between bright red and a duller red.  \n\n\nMy alignment is too far off to use other red/green games effectively and anything that lets me see a shadow with my strong eye becomes less effective because I have to force or choose to use my weak eye instead of the shadow.  With this Beat Saber arrangement I can't cheat.  I have to utilize my weak eye to play the game.  Not only that, but apparently the arrows being visible to both eyes helps with alignment.  Without effort I only see black blocks.  When I make the effort to discern with my weak eye I then only see the bright red or dark red blocks.  In other words, it seems to be the best alignment I have achieved from any app or experiment I have tried to date.  I have not detected any ghosting.  Either I'm being lazy and see black blocks or I am adding effort to my weak eye and seeing the same block in color.\n\nAdditionally, I have been using Skully Candy Crusher headphones.  They have haptic bass which means they vibrate to bass to boost the sensation of pounding bass without actually destroying a person's hearing.  In treatment, it's common for a therapist to snap fingers or have a person do something to help wake their weak eye up.  In theory and apparently in practice, the haptic bass seems to be helping to do that too.  \n\n\nBut wait, there is more.  Beat Saber has a multiplayer option so you can actually compete against other people while getting eye exercise with this method.  \n\n\nI own a Valve Index, but apparently a coating on the lenses did not like even a single round with the red green insert so I switched to the Quest.  I am using the Original Quest which has OLED displays.  That better contrast in colors may be a benefit to this technique.  A person can find the original Quests fairly cheap on Ebay.  The Quest 2 starts at $300 and should work but I haven't actually tested it.  The insert hasn't affected the lenses on my Quest and even stays better in one place the way it fits in the headset, plus I have the added benefit of being able to show my therapists what I am doing.  \n\n\nThe Beat Saber base game costs $30.  It's fun and it can be great cardio exercise once a person has progressed into harder maps.  I can play expert Plus maps, and I recommend that people get a feel for the game without the glasses to make the sessions with glasses more effective.  I cannot play expert or expert plus with this vision treatment setup.  Since I can compare my normal skill to the vision treatment skill I have a way to gauge potential improvement along the way.    \n\n\nFinally, I feel this in my eye in a way that's consistent with what I have felt at times with in office Vivid Vision.  I'm not an eye dr.  I'm making no guarantees, but for less than $500 a person can have a good, fun, exercise option and of course you would have  VR device for other enjoyment as well verses spending  $1000 or so on a period of treatment that either accomplished something or did not accomplish anything but ends after a time period regardless.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Amblyopia/comments/o93j9a/affordable_vr_amblyopia_exercise_using_beat_saber/

It's always been that way I suppose. My amblyopia is not significant according to the doctors as my left eye with this amblyopia is 25/20 (or 20/25, idk which) and my right is 20/20.\n\nThe recommended me go to an optometrist for glasses which is in a month.\n\nI guess my biggest concern is me forming strabismus. Can refractive amblyopia cause strabismus?? If so, how long could it take and what can I do to prevent it?\n\nAny advice is deeply appreciated\n\n\* EDIT: I still see everything 3D and vision is pretty much fine out of my left eye although sometimes it is slightly blurry when looking at things far away.\*",https://www.reddit.com/r/Amblyopia/comments/nxjz7f/can_refractive_ambloypoia_cause_strabismus_long/

My cornea is already at stage 3.\n\nMy eyesight on the weak eye has deteriorated so badly over the damage done through the years unaddressed, prescription now at a whopping 1825.

nw30wp,1623264015,Doctors disagreeing,"Hi There, \n\nWe took my three year old son to the optometrist for his first checkup and were shocked to find out he hand amblyopia.  20/400 in his one eye to start I believe.  We know a reliable source (a reputable ophtamologist) that said she was a very good optometrist.   \n\nShe gave him glasses and told us to come back in 7 weeks.  In the meantime we had an appointment with an ophthalmologist, who recommended 2 hours of patching per day and come back in 6 months, and stop seeing the optomologist.  \n\nThat was the plan, until we noticed my son, during patching, always wanted to look at things sideways.  We thought this was a glasses thing, so we went back to the optomologist to fix the glasses, but didn't realize they booked us for another checkup.  Anyways when we were there she said his eye was improving but he needed a different prescription.  She said she wouldn't have recommended patching, but thinks that max one hour is ok, and more could be damaging to binocular vision.  She also said come back in 7 weeks. \n\nSo now we're sort of between two doctors.  On the one hand it seems that the patching significantly benefit his vision (improved to 20/50 in weeks) which we wouldn't have dont if not for the ophtamologist, but we also wouldn't have changed his prescription if we didn't go back to the optomologist.  \n\nIt seems like it would be difficult to keep seeing both of these doctors who seemingly disagree on the best path forward. \n\nWhat should we do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Amblyopia/comments/nw30wp/doctors_disagreeing/

nm61tr,1622117571,Vivid Vision Therapy in Australia.,"Hi there, \n\nObligatory ""I'm new here"" intro: I'm Renee, early thirties, diagnosed with ""lazy eye"" of the left eye when I was approximately five. Tried and hated patching, hid my glasses so well that they disappeared off the face of the earth, and eventually came to accept that I was always going to be mostly blind in my affected eye. It wasn't until I was in my twenties that I did some digging on my own and learned that my particular condition is called Amblyopia (after a friend insisted that I couldn't *possibly* have a lazy eye, because both of my eyes look completely normal!) and that while it isn't ""curable"", it is in fact treatable by various means. \n\nSkip through to the past two days: friend and I have been playing a video game for weeks on end, myself on PC and her on VR, and she's been trying to convince me to get an Oculus. I'm pretty much sold on the idea until last night it occurs to me that having Amblyopia might affect my ability to use a VR headset. So to Google I go, to see if any other sufferers have successfully used VR without issue. \n\nI fell down a rabbit hole and discovered Vivid Vision Therapy. \n\nTo say I'm impressed by the claims, the reviews, and the success stories is an understatement. I immediately wanted to buy that Oculus and jump right into this, especially since it could be done at home! \n\nAnd then I discovered that to get it, you need a prescription from an optometrist. And it's potentially crazy expensive. And the ""closest"" clinics to me that offer it are very much out of the way, especially for somebody with a crazy, unpredictable work schedule. \n\nSo, my questions: are there any Australians out there who have tried/are using VVT? How is it cost-wise here? How often are you having to go into a clinic/have you been able to do it at home? I'm based in Sydney, and would love if there are any locals who could offer their insight.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Amblyopia/comments/nm61tr/vivid_vision_therapy_in_australia/

The day before yesterday, I met a 40-year-old person with left eye amblyopia on social media. She has never had strabismus. Is the possibility or onset of strabismus affected by the type of amblyopiaÔºüShe and I are both refractive amblyopia.

mqyf1a,1618429629,Looking for advice or general feedback regarding our son,"He's about 18 months old and for the last 8-10 months we've noticed his right eye is occasionally 'lazy'.    About two months ago I brought him to a pediatric Ophthalmologist to get it checked out and he did a bunch of tests and essentially said that our little guy is farsighted and would almost certainly grow out if it and the lazy eye, but let's see him again in six months to see if things are progressing.  Well, a couple months goes by and we see no change so we make an appointment to get a second opinion.  The new doc seems quite a bit more concerned - evaluation was -  **Esotropia of both eyes, Hyperopia of both eyes, Amblyopia suspect, right eye.**  Prescribed glasses and two hours of patch per day and we will see the doc again in six weeks.  She did mention that if the glasses appear to be working, he'll likely need to wear them until he's 8(!) or so.  Obviously surgery is viewed as a last resort and they want to try other options before we resort to that....but am I crazy for thinking that if we don't see miraculous results within the first couple or few months, I'd probably like to just go ahead and get the surgery while he's young?  The sooner, the better?  Also, it's going to be absolutely hell trying to get him to wear glasses and I imagine the patch will be even worse.  Am I not thinking clearly?  I've read that the surgery has a very high success rate and is pretty routine.\n\nAlso, just want to add that he walks fine, picks up little items and food with no issue so he doesn't seem to be hampered by his issues at this time.\n\nNot really sure what I'm looking for, just a concerned and stressed out parent looking for advice, I guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4iiadfh07t61.jpg?width=240&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c7cc31b1d6ee99df42d28c11531fdda904de590",https://www.reddit.com/r/Amblyopia/comments/mqyf1a/looking_for_advice_or_general_feedback_regarding/

mj6dq4,1617447693,Can someone please help me figure out what's wrong because doctors in my country are giving me different opinions (binocular double vision after trauma),"This post is on behalf on my bf 27M, who was in a car accident in November that caused an orbital blowout fracture in his right eye. Since then, he has had double vision and we are struggling to find any doctor that can help in our country, as a matter of fact he hasn‚Äôt even been properly diagnosed even after visiting 6 different doctors. Any insight or directions are welcome because he is having a really tough time both physically and mentally and we don‚Äôt wanna lose hope. \n\nHere are the details of his condition, the pictures are linked down below : \n\n**Symptoms he‚Äôs experiencing:**\n\nVertical/horizontal/torsional diplopia worsening in the far right gaze \n\n**Medical procedures:**\n\n16 days after the accident, the doctors recommended a surgery that consists in inserting a vicryl plate above the orbital floor \n\n**After the surgery:** \n\nRight after the surgery he starts noticing a tilt in his right eye. Now, he sees double and gets nauseous and lose balance a lot. It appears that his eye is enophthalmos.\n\n**Doctors recommendations:**\n\nThe doctor who did the surgery projected that he will get better after one month, but he didn‚Äôt. This prompted him to seek another doctor who suggested covering his right eye (occlusion) for a month and seeing if it gets any better. Again, he did but with no improvements. \n\nHe visited 2 others doctors who each suggested different things (strabismus and surgery after 9 months of trauma , a corrective orbital surgery  because the eye doesn‚Äôt look in it‚Äôs right place causing it to be misaligned with the other )\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nHe has received different opinions, and no doctor actually could determine what the issue is. \n\nWe did a lot of research online and his condition looks a lot like a 4th nerve palsy mixed with misplacement of the eye in the orbital socket. \n\n**Does someone have any experience with a similar case ? or any insight about how to proceed ? or any possible solutions ? We would be very very grateful for any input .** \n\n[Here‚Äôs a link for his CT scans (before the surgery) and  medical reports before and after the procedure .](https://imgur.com/a/9GU5qVf) \n\n[Here's a link for a picture of his eyes and video of him moving his eyes in multiple directions.](https://imgur.com/a/yhCGiLe)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Can someone help diagnose or give us an opinion about what this issue could be , symptoms = misplacement of right eye and vertical, horizontal and torsional diplopia.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Amblyopia/comments/mj6dq4/can_someone_please_help_me_figure_out_whats_wrong/

m59bai,1615771065,I resent my parents for their neglect of this condition.,"My mum, as demonstrated with family pets is fairly negligent and I have had to pressure her into booking vet appointments numerous times for blatant issues that she would write off. My parents are both smokers and I argue frequently about them smoking in the house. She also said to my pregnant sister that one glass of wine wouldn‚Äôt hurt her, making me think about how her blatant neglect and disregard has affected me and my life. Smoke exposure is linked to foetuses and babies developing amblyopia. I am a twin, so my moms response was that because my sibling doesn‚Äôt have it, she didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, which anyone with any shred of medical knowledge would see as extremely ignorant and dare I say a stupid response. My dad just doesn‚Äôt care and let‚Äôs my mum deal with this sort of stuff.\n\nI know it isn‚Äôt healthy to dwell on things like this, but I can‚Äôt shrug it off. Sooner or later the idea comes back up and it sickens me that I have to live with the consequences of another‚Äôs selfishness. Amblyopia and it‚Äôs associated conditions have ruined my life. I am socially stunted due to the shame and embarrassment I have felt my whole life regarding the strabismus as it led me to avoid social interactions in fear of being ostracised and picked out. It has left me with severe depression, social anxiety and tremendously low self esteem. It is the root of all my suffering. I missed out on crucial social and confidence development in my childhood that no work in adulthood will displace. \n\nI have to in good conscience note that I was taken to see an optician about it when I was young and they recommended patching, only my parents never explained to me, a young child, about the condition and how it would help or make me wear them, it was basically dropped the day after as far as I can remember.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Amblyopia/comments/m59bai/i_resent_my_parents_for_their_neglect_of_this/
