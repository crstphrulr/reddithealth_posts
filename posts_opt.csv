uehej9,1651221398,First time corneal abrasion,"Hey all! First time posting here and also first time to have corneal abrasion. All right so I'll cut to the chase. \n\nFIRST DAY (yesterday) - woke up at 4 AM thinking that a bug got inside my left eye and is stuck in my upper eyelid. Went to the mirror to check and my eye was red. Thought I got conjunctivitis again so I used Patanol for relief. No effect because the entire day my left eye was watery. It hurt to blink and whenever I did blink I had to close my left eye for a few seconds before opening it again. Tried ice pack, tried steaming.  \n\nSECOND DAY (today) - woke up at 2 AM with crusty and tearing left eye. Left eye too sensitive to light so I went back to sleep. Woke up around 7 or 8 AM, left eye tearing so much and also redder this time. Decided to go to ophthalmologist. Found out I have corneal abrasion :---) Likely rubbed my left eye too hard but didn't notice it. Ophthalmologist says that it's a small one, but prescribed Vigamox for 7 days. Also wants me to come back on May 4 to see progress. \n\nPROGRESS SO FAR: Left eye stopped tearing and now I can actually blink again. Still wearing sunglasses so as not to strain my left eye too hard. \n\nJust have two questions: \n\n1) Should I be worried about what happened to me (i.e. corneal abrasion)? \n\n2) Can I still use screens (working with laptop, phone as I have a couple of deadlines to meet) while recovering? \n\nThank you all!",https://www.reddit.com/r/optometry/comments/uehej9/first_time_corneal_abrasion/

It's much higher than normal to where the frame top is siting at the top of my eyebrow level to help improve with this... distortion/disoriented focus. It also places my lenses so close that they're rubbing my eyelashes, which is somewhat irritating.\n\nIt's only been a few days, so I'm hoping I'll adjust, but I'm wondering at what point I should go back to the eye doc to discuss it.

uee03w,1651206957,Is This Malpractice?,"Hey ya’ll! i didn’t really know where else to ask this and thought it would be the best place. For background I was born with morning glory syndrome and my retina detached in June of last year. I noticed something weird going on in my eye and I went to my optometrist. she immediately got me an appointment to see a retina specialist and insisted it was an emergency surgery because i had a 70% detachment. I saw the specialist the next day, he confirmed the 70% detachment and pushed my surgery to a month out.\n\nThat didn’t concern me as much as how the surgery went. For the whole month before the surgery the plan was to get the scleral buckle and the silicone oil for a more permanent fix. Now to the day of the surgery: The surgery was going fine until mid way through I woke up. During this time he told me he was going to use the cryotherapy method which freezes the retina. They did not put me back under anesthesia until I was feeling pain. I healed up fine but at the 3 month mark my retina had detached again and we decided no more surgeries. After doing research I found that the cryotherapy method is used on simple tears and definitely not a 70% detachment. I am now more blind than before. After putting this all together it just seems so off to me. I want to explain that the change in procedure was never discussed prior to surgery and it was only mentioned during surgery.

Currently an RN so my understanding of eye disorders is very basic at best but my initial concern was possible MS. However, this was ruled out. \n\nIt’s been several months so my recollection isn’t perfect - but I initially saw an ophthalmologist who, after several tests, was baffled and confused at the results. He referred me to a different ophthalmologist who again, was confused and could not explain what she was seeing or why considering MRI results were normal. I was finally referred to a specialist who, after much testing and months of waiting, confirmed I simply had Optic Neuritis and stated that there wasn’t an identifiable cause. Additionally, I was informed that while my vision loss was unlikely to extend to my other eye, there wasn’t any current treatment options nor would corrective lenses be of use.\n\nSince then, vision hasn’t improved much nor has it worsened.

It's so small that it's really hard to definitely say my vision is worse than with my previous glasses, but it definitely is not better, which is the whole point of getting new ones in the first place.\n\nMy measurements, as far as I can read the doctor's handwriting, are\n\nLeft eye: -4.50, -1.25 | 12 ° \n\nRight eye: -5.25, -1.0 | 173  ° \n\nI have to say, when she was measuring my eyesight, anything she changed out looked more or less the same, and I never felt like it was crystal clear. I even felt like when I put on my old glasses, I saw better, but I attributed that to my eyes being confused due to her changing out the lenses while examining.\n\nShould I wait a few more days, or put on my old glasses and get a new measurement?\n\nThank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/optometry/comments/udv430/blurry_vision_after_new_glasses/

udunpf,1651151457,Scopolamine Patch,"Hello, 38yo female, 5’2”, 140lbs here. I had pelvic surgery on 4/7/22 and the anesthesiologist gave me a scopolamine patch for nausea. The nurse warned me to wash my hands if I touched it because it can dilate your eyes. She said that I could wear it for 3 days. I was very careful to wash my hands if I accidentally touched it. But still I woke up 48 hours after my surgery with blurred vision at which point I took the patch off immediately and contacted my surgeon’s office. The doctor said the effects should wear off in a day or so.   After a couple days of continuing blurred vision, I got nervous so I went to the ER and they said my pupils were still dilated and attributed it to the scopolamine.  After a week, my pupil dilation went mostly away but I was still having blurred vision and trouble seeing in dim lighting. I then went to an eye Dr who checked everything and said my eyes were healthy and that I needed to continue to wait for the scopolamine to wear off.  It has now been about 3 weeks and while the blurry vision has improved somewhat, I’m still having issuing with dry eyes and “accommodation” so that focusing and dim lighting remain a problem. I’m starting to get terrified that this is never going to go away because doctors keep telling to wait and it should go away in a couple more days. But every time a couple more days goes by I’m still dealing with these symptoms. I now know scopolamine has an anticholingeric effect on the parasympathetic nervous system, and I’m worried it’s cause permanent changes for me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/optometry/comments/udunpf/scopolamine_patch/

udoi0z,1651126815,Eyezen Lense Usage,"Hi all, I was prescribed Eyezen lenses because I have eye fatigue but no other eye problems, which results in mild difficulties with me seeing far (especially at night) and headaches from all the reading/screen time that comes along with grad school. At first I was prescribed to wear the Eyezen all the time by my optometrist and then I went back because everything that was not at screen distance looked fairly blurry (I couldn’t see my teachers faces in class or make out words on presentation screens).  I told the optician I couldn’t see far and they checked one eye with me looking at a sign about 8-10ft away and said an adjustment needed to be made and sent them back to the manufacturer to get it fixed. I picked up the glasses and the optician said that I only need to wear then for reading. I feel like now I can see far and close in one eye but the other is still blurry for distanced items and it results in me only being able to see near overall. So I went back today again just to get clarification on why they are now only for reading since when I bought these I was under the impression that the prescription called for all day use/I would be able to wear them all the time. They said they adjusted them to be reading glasses because I asked for that the last time (which I didn’t think I did since we were looking at text far away). I asked if using these glasses would address my difficulties with seeing far away overtime even though they are geared towards short distance. And they said it helps with general eye health, then asked me what prescription I would want because they can change it, which was confusing because I honestly don’t know what I need/was hoping they could advise. I feel confused about what I paid for and am not sure If I should have spent the $500 or asked for adjustments (maybe I asked for the wrong adjustment without knowing it?). Can someone please explain Eyezen in layman terms? Is Eyezen for all the time use or are they reading glasses? And what should I have asked for/how do I make sure I have the “correct” prescription. If i change my glasses to distance vision will I still get the benefits of Eyezen?

udnk5n,1651123095,How to Choose the Right Frame Size for Your Glasses?," There are a couple of things to look at when investing in glasses. They’re meant to supplement or correct your vision while remaining to be comfortable to wear. The wrong frame size for your glasses can be incredibly uncomfortable - it can put a lot of pressure on your upper nose, eyes, and head, leading to aches and pains in these areas, sometimes even leaving temporary but painful dents in the skin. Additionally, frames in the wrong size can also have the opposite effect that they’re supposed to have on your power and vision.\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind when selecting frames for your glasses. While all your options may look good, they may not bode well on your face. Here are a few pointers to keep in mind when selecting your eyeglasses frames:\n\n* Width: The width should not exceed your temples on either side of your face. Otherwise, they’ll feel heavy and make your face ache.\n* Height:\n   * The glasses shouldn’t be resting on your cheeks so as to avoid friction burn and excessive pressure on your cheekbones.\n   * They can be slightly higher than your eyebrows if you’re looking to switch up the style. Once again, this can add pressure to your cheekbones.\n\nEnsure that you select frames that are correctly shaped for your face - not from a style perspective, but the comfort one. Your eye doctor can recommend the kind of [**eyeglass frames**](https://optica.africa/collections/all-spectacles-frames) that would be right for your face.",https://www.reddit.com/r/optometry/comments/udnk5n/how_to_choose_the_right_frame_size_for_your/
udnj8m,1651123004,"Are all antiglare lenses similarly effective, or are cheaper ones worse?"," There is a reason why cheaper products are priced such. The reason behind this is that many times we think we’re buying [**anti-glare glasses**](https://optica.africa/products/singlevision-value-anti-glare) or lenses, but they’re really just anti-reflective lenses or antiglare with cheaper coating.\n\nMany businesses are only in it for, well, the business - the money side of it. With manufacturers and sellers like this, it is the quantity that matters more than the quality of the products. Of course, these goods are also sold cheaper in larger volumes, thus leading to higher profit margins. When the actual product is compromised so that economics can work in full stride, there’s not much to be said about the product.\n\nIn the same way, the more expensive glasses that are crafted more carefully are also generally more effective. They are legitimate products made for eye care, so they can be trusted more than the cheaper brands. You can see it in the touch and feel of the products, too.\n\nYou would notice that eyeglasses you get from places like grocery stores and street markets, even if they promise antiglare coating, spoil very quickly. Those prescribed to you and provided to you by your eye doctor are, in general, sturdier, more durable, and much more resistant to wear and tear.\n\nSo, no, all [**anti-glare glasses**](https://optica.africa/products/singlevision-value-anti-glare) are not effective. There are cheaper brands that are, in part, effective, but you need to know not to skimp on your glasses.

udggpm,1651100626,Update on previous issue I was having with glare. Thoughts?,"I’ve posted here a few times seeking a solution for a troubling issue I’ve been having with glare (I’m not sure if that’s the right term) for the last year.\n\nTo briefly summarize:\n\nAround 1 year ago, after my contact prescription was changed from -5.75 (both eyes) to -6.5, I started noticing annoying glare in my left eyes due to bright lights. It was especially noticeable at night and made wearing contacts intolerable. I used to describe this phenomenon as my vision “going out” or “giving up.” It would be crisp during the day, then at nightfall, it would be as if my eyes were extremely dry or if my contacts had been worn for too long.\n\nIn essence, the normal halo that you sometimes see around lights (such as street lights) is more noticeable and fuzzier when looking out of my left eye as opposed to my right. The unevenness in the field of vision throws everything off and makes wearing my contacts extremely annoying. It’s as if my left eye is more sensitive to the light coming in than the right eye. It’s much more tolerable when I wear my glasses (-7.25 both eyes), and so I try to wear glasses as much as possible.\n\nI saw three eye doctors about this in the last year. All of them said that my eyes, and the nerves and blood vessels therein, were healthy and attributed the issue to my eyes adjusting poorly to a new prescription. So they tried out prescriptions everywhere between -6 and -7, finally settling at -7 for both eyes. I think -7 is the best, but it’s completely random: some days I see crisper than others, some days I can’t stand wearing my contacts at all. I felt sort of rushed out the door by the doctors since they couldn’t detect anything on the imaging and I’m seeing 20:20. It’s also just hard to describe the effect in general.\n\nI was pretty hopeless given the time and effort I’d put into this without finding a solution. But the other day, I noticed something interesting.\n\nI began noticing some very faint black “floaters” in my left eye that I can control with my head movements. For instance, if I concentrate on the floaters and move my head quickly to the left, then I observe the floaters moving in the same direction. I tested this while looking with my left eye in the direction of a bright overhead light, and when one of the floaters passed directly in front of the light, I experienced the exact same glare or “fuzziness” I’ve been noticing for the last year. When I was able to control the floaters and move them out of the way of the light, it was as crisp as before. I have some similar floaters in my right eye, but they don’t seem to be as centrally located as they are in my left eye, or perhaps they just don’t bother me as much in the right eye for some reason.\n\nSo I feel like I’m onto something, but I don’t know where to go from here. Has anyone heard of something like this before? Is this the kind of manner in which floaters normally behave? None of the doctors I saw even mentioned floaters, and I hadn’t noticed them myself before recently.\n\nThey don’t look like the images of floaters that I see on Google; they’re more faint than that and move pretty quickly about my eye.",https://www.reddit.com/r/optometry/comments/udggpm/update_on_previous_issue_i_was_having_with_glare/
udfqq4,1651098587,Question about contact lenses and the advice that my doctor gave me,"I have recently gone to a clinic that specializes in strabismus. In the past 2 years I have developed this thing where one of my eyes will drift laterally whenever I lose focus. It started first with right eye and then the left (but never at the same time) and has begun to happen more frequently. \n\nAnyway, the doctor did the exam and gave me a new prescription for glasses and told me that if I wear them or contacts constantly then the issue should go away. If it doesn’t then I should come back for appointments for orthoptic exercises. Does the advice for wearing glasses/contacts all the time seem correct and is it truly possible that it will potentially make my issue go away completely?

Looking into the potential risks it seems like glaucoma is one, particularly if one has a narrow angle of the anterior chamber of the eye. I have a couple questions:\n\n1) Is having a narrow angle in the anterior chamber more common with keratoconus? \n\n2) Is having thin corneas a contraindication for SSRIs for any reason?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not in extremely dire straits mentally, so while I'd like to try the drug in addition to some therapy, I'm fine with holding off if there's a not insignificant chance of eye related risks.

ucp5n3,1651013930,“Symmetrical Optic Nerve Swelling”?,"(22M, nearsighted with -3.75 prescription) I went to the eye doctor today due to some visual distortion (straight lines appearing wavy in the periphery of my right eye). My intraocular pressure was 22. They dilated my eyes, used the machine to take a picture of my retina, and then the optometrist took a look in my eyes manually with the flashlight thing. He immediately remarked that my optic nerve in the right eye appeared swollen and that he might have to refer me to an ophthalmologist.\n\n\nUpon his request, they took more pictures with the retina scanning machine, I did a visual field test, and then he spoke to me again. He basically said that my optic nerve is actually swollen in both eyes, but the swelling is symmetrical, which leads him to think it isn’t pathological (along with the fact my visual field test results were excellent). He says it might just be “how I am” and to see him again if anything changes. He didn’t give me a referral like he originally was planning on after initially seeing the swelling in my right eye. He hypothesized that the visual distortion in my right eye is due to a floater.\n\n\nShould I get a second opinion?

There are some things I found new to me. Can you please check and advise if I should just change clinic next time or if this is common practice for prescribing glasses in the US? I have just myopia and gladly other issues.\n\n1. While choosing a new prescription for my new glasses, the doctor neither asked if I feel comfortable with those lenses nor asked me to walk and look around. He was doing lens selection for me by asking if I see the chart or not.\n2. He just gave me a paper with my prescription without explaining anything. Like, ""Here's your papers, come back next year"". When glasses were produced, they appeared to have astigmatism correction in addition to my normal myopia correction. My old glasses didn't have one, and I wasn't told I need it now.\n3. Then an eyewear store in that clinic had produced glasses: both lenses had some kind of engraving which is slightly visible when I wear those glasses. They said that is not a defect and rather a unique signature. I never had anything engraved on any of my lenses. Is this normal to have anything in the lens? Feels like I need to wipe glasses.\n\nBonus questions:\n\n4. My husband went to the same clinic to get a new pack of soft lenses he ran out of. They said he has to pay a ""lens fitting"" fee on top of everything (exam and lenses) which is mandatory. Lens fitting of the same brand and lens type he has been wearing every day for a decade. He just removed the old lenses and put in fresh ones. Is this also a common fee?\n\n5. When asking for a new prescription next time, do I have a right to say that I don't feel comfortable with that astigmatism correction or I would like a less strong prescription? Or there is a protocol that only the doctor decides what prescription I have to wear?\n\nI've been wearing glasses for the last 25 years, and have been to different optometrists and ophthalmologists many times, in public clinics, in-store optometrists, or in private.

ubv0mn,1650919465,Seeing black flashes of light when moving eyes or when standing up.,"Recently I saw my ophthalmologist with a scan of my retinas. The images and exam showed everything was fine and my retinas were healthy. But for some reason, I am seeing weird black flashes of light in the shape of blobs. They look like the aftermath of staring at a bright light, when you see a dark spot that lingers for a few seconds. Though these blobs go away just as fast as they appear. I've had them show up not too frequently in the past but now they happen every day. Not every second but when I stand up, exercise or if I look around too quickly.  \n\nDoes anyone else have these dark flashes of light? I have floaters and visual snow in darker light conditions along with after images. These blobs show up in darker light and are practically gone when I'm outside. I also get very tiny flashes or dots that pop into view every so often, not white blood cells. I can also see the blood vessels in the back of my eyes when I look at a bright clear wall or big screen/sky which is really weird. It's got my anxiety flaring up, mostly worried they'll distract me when I drive or it's something serious. I did have a brief case of chronic migraines with ocular migraines a few months ago, that has thankfully cleared up. \n\nDoes anyone else have these dark flashes of light?

Recently decided I needed new glasses since I hadn't had my eyes checked since before the pandemic.\n\n\nMy old optometrist was over an hour away so I figured that I'd just get my eyes checked at the local LensCrafters. (Not my best idea). I thought it would be fine since the lady who checked my eyes is a doctor of optometry so i figured she knew what she was doing (even with my weird eyes).

ubrxdw,1650911468,Problem with lens where only the very middle is in focus,"Hi smart people, hoping someone can help as I've tried to Google and ask the ""fitters"" at the Optometrist (so not the Dr.) and couldn't get any kind of straight answer.\n\nI had an eye exam and got a fresh prescription (-4.25, -1.25, x180, -3.75, -2.5, x169), and due reasons, I had to quickly order some new glasses online (EyeBuyDirect, the more upscale RFLKT line, FWIW).  The right lens is great, but the problem is in my left eye, (which has more Astigmatism I guess?) where only the very middle of the lens is in focus, and as I start to look out in any other direction, even slightly, it's blurry.  I suffered through for a couple months, hoping this was part of the adjustment, even though I knew it probably wasn't.\n\nAt some point I decided the problem wasn't going to go away, so I went back to my Optometrist to order glasses from them.  While I was there, I asked them to check the prescription in my online glasses, and they said it was correct.  Also, one of the ""fitters"" recommended getting a ""digital aspheric lens"" to address my concern on the new glasses, for a minimal charge, so I did that.  Even after Googling, I still don't understand if it's related to my problem or not, but after getting the new glasses, the lenses are great, no blurriness at all across the whole lens.  Except the problem now is I don't really care for the frames.\n\nI would love to go back to online to save a buck (I used my insurance credit on the Optometrist pair), but obviously only if I can resolve this radial blurriness problem.  I had previously ordered from Warby Parker and never had the problem, I tried Googling to see if they do this magic ""digital aspheric"" thing which may or may-not be related, but couldn't find much.  So I'm hoping that this is an obvious problem, and I don't know the right thing to search for, and someone here will have an obvious answer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/optometry/comments/ubrxdw/problem_with_lens_where_only_the_very_middle_is/

ubqma3,1650907969,new glasses after cataract surgery in one eye,"I have had a cataract removed on my left eye about a year ago and has an implant to correct my nearsightness.  I have been back to my ophthalmologist every 3 months for checkups and so far so good.  My left eye is 20/20 when they tested me.\n\nMy right eye has no cataract, my ophthalmologist said I should consider doing the right eye to correct the different images, but I can wait, because he thinks it's a matter of time before I develop a cataract on my right eye as well.  Right now I am wearing the glasses I had before the surgery, but with the left lens popped out and replaced with a demo lens since my left eye is 50/50.\n\nHowever reading books and computers is an issue since I have progressive where my right eye has reading correction, but the left eye being a demo lens has no reading prescription.\n\nSo I went back to my ophthalmologist for another checkup last week, and mentioned to him I want to get new glasses to correct for reading only on the left eye, he sent me to the optometrist in the same office, and this my new prescriptions.\n\nOD  Sphere: -6.75 Cylinder: +0.25 Axis: 080 ADD: +2.00\n\nOS  Sphere: -0.50 Cylinder: +0.50 Axis: 075 ADD: +2.00\n\nMy questions are:\n\nWhen I was in the ophthalmologist's office they had me read the eye chart each time and told me I am 20/20 on the left eye the one that was operated on.\n\nWhen I went to the optometrist next door they used a machine to scan my eye where I focused on an image, and when the optometrist fitted me with lens I end up being -0.50 on the left eye.  So now I have -0.50 on my left eye on top of the lens that was implanted.  Is that usual?  Does it mean the original implant under corrected or my eye sight has changed?\n\nI do realize my left and right has a large difference now and that causes different image sizes.  It was driving me crazy the first week after the surgery but now I am not seeing any problems.  My ophthalmologist has checked me and said apparently my brain is able to process the different image sizes and reconcile them.  I have done some testing myself, sitting down and looking at a fixed object  at 20 feet away.  If I cover my left eye, I see a smaller object.  If I cover my right eye, I see a larger object.  If I open both eyes, the image size is one that is ""in between"".  However, if I turn my head to the right and look at that object at an extreme angle on the peripheral, I see two images, so that's when it bothers me but I rarely have a need to do that.\n\nNow I have new questions in getting new glasses.\n\n(1) due to the difference in the left and right, my right eye will have much thicker glasses.  The left eye no so much.  I will end up with different thicknesses and weights.  What is the best way to balance that?  Should I attempt to use high index lens like 1.74 for my right eye but standard polycarbonate for my left eye to even out the thickness difference?\n\n(2) with respect to reading, I guess I am still not quite understanding the implanted lens.  It was implanted to correct my near sight that was close to -7.25 at the time, so if I get a pair of new glasses with the +2.00 for reading correction, does that mean there is a double correction?  That when I am reading a book, the light will go through the reading correction at the bottom of my new glasses, then onto my lens implant and get another correction before landing on the retina?  I am kind of confused.\n\n(3) There are many options now with new glasses, UV, blue light...are any of these truly beneficial or just new options to add cost?\n\nThank you very much and sorry for the long post.",https://www.reddit.com/r/optometry/comments/ubqma3/new_glasses_after_cataract_surgery_in_one_eye/

my luck cant be this bad, at this point im very devastated, i have quit my studies, and i have quit everything in life.\n\ni dont know what to do anymore, im afraid my corneas will get worse overtime since the steroids have caused collagen breakdown and thinning and pain is still here everyday after 5 months now, the pain is dull sometimes sharp sometimes in the cheek sometimes shooting pain thru the eye to my brain. PLEASE if youre a doctor i need some info if this happened with your patiens or any have experienced similar situation. i want to know is this gonna get worse or from what ive studied that keratocytes regenerate collagen even though it takes years. ill appreaciate any help. and if you need to look at the topography scans i send them for you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/optometry/comments/ubauy5/any_ophthalmologist_or_optometrist_here_anyone/

u9xble,1650688205,Optometrists: can you help me understand my 5 yo son’s recent diagnosis?,"My son is in kindergarten, and at his school they do vision screenings in 1st grade, but I decided to take him to my optometrist when we noticed he was doing a lot of blinking and squinting, as well as moving closer to the television saying he could not see it from across the room. During the screening, he could see practically none of the letters with either eye (he knows his letters so that’s not the issue). The doctor then used the typical machines  (sorry I don’t know the names) to examine his eyes, and said that his vision is VERY poor, which was pretty apparent at this point, and that in addition to astigmatisms, he had severe far-sightedness and amblyopia (not presenting as a “wandering eye”). He’s going to need to wear glasses with a pretty intense prescription. By the end of the visit I was a little overwhelmed with all this info- I suspected he might need glasses but I had no idea how bad his vision truly was. My son was fitted for frames and we’ll pick them up in about another week, and I intend to ask some follow up questions then, but I cannot stop wondering… if it’s far-sightedness that he’s dealing with, why does he say that he sees the tv better up close? And just today he told me that his teacher moved him to the front of the classroom and he can see the board so much better now. Is it because of the astigmatisms? Just trying to make sense of this, and insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/optometry/comments/u9xble/optometrists_can_you_help_me_understand_my_5_yo/

u9tzn9,1650677114,Long-time trouble with contacts,"I've been wearing glasses for about 13 years (I'm 24), and every few optometrist visits I decide I want to try contacts. Every time I try them I wear them for the two week adjustment period that the doctor suggests, but then I don't refill the prescription the next month and use my old glasses until my next appointment rolls around. I've done this three times. It's disappointing and feels like a huge waste, but I keep doing it because I really want contacts to work for me. I run into the same problem every time. With the contacts on, my vision remains blurry and things still are hard to focus on up close and far away. It's not as bad as no correction at all, but it would probably be unsafe to drive and I would have trouble ordering from a menu board. It's really disorienting and unpleasant.\n\nSo, I do have an astigmatism in one eye, however I've had two different optometrists tell me it's too slight to be worth investing in special contacts, even after I express the issues I've had with contacts in the past. I have no trouble putting them in or taking them out and I find them pretty comfortable, so the only issue is that I can't fully see with any contact prescription I've had. I'd probably love wearing them instead of glasses if this wasn't the case. Honestly, a part of the reasoning against the astigmatism lenses in the past was the price, but there so many more options now and my insurance is much better. Is it worth pressing my optometrist about this problem?  Or should I just give up on trying to making contacts work?  Thank you! It's about time for me to make an appointment again and I've been kicking this around in my head a lot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/optometry/comments/u9tzn9/longtime_trouble_with_contacts/
