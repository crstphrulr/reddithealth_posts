ueb8aq,1651197844,Has anyone tried dual therapy (oral appliance + CPAP)?,I got diagnosed with moderate sleep apnea 3 months ago. Got a CPAP that hasn't really helped. \n\nSaw an ENT that said I had a mild deviated septum and mallampati score of 4. Recommended an oral appliance and to ditch my cpap. \n\nAfterwards I went to another ENT who specializes in surgery for sleep apnea patients. He said my septum deviation was not mild but enough to warrant a surgery if oral appliance fails. He also said that I had a large tongue which was the reason for a mallampati score of 4 and also recommended an oral appliance. \n\nI have gone ahead and ordered an oral appliance but not convinced that just using an oral appliance would work. I had hired a CPAP technician (I'm sure that's not what they're really called) to help optimize my pressure levels and we couldn't make anything work. His conclusion was there was some form of restriction that just wouldn't let the cpap do its work. \n\nWith the ENT confirming a deviated septum I was wondering if an oral appliance to make some room at the throat and then also use a CPAP through the nose would be useful?\n\nAnd if that doesn't work would getting the deviated septum fixed help with CPAP working with the restriction removed from the nose level and/or using an oral appliance only. \n\nWould really appreciate anyone chiming in on this especially if they're gone through a similar situation.,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/ueb8aq/has_anyone_tried_dual_therapy_oral_appliance_cpap/

ue41t8,1651176739,Conflicting PSG &amp; sleep endoscopy (DISE),"Hi everyone. I was diagnosed with OSA about 2 years ago after an in-lab PSG showed mild-moderate apnea (almost exclusively hypopneas with almost no desats). I then had a titration study that showed similar results; this was about 8 months ago). Just this week I had a drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) that showed total collapse/obstruction at my tongue base and epiglottis. I haven’t gained weight since the PSGs or started drinking more alcohol or anything. Has anyone else seen such a huge discrepancy between test results, whether PSG and DISE or others? I’ve read that the anesthesia administered during DISE can sometimes cause more airway collapse than would normally occur during natural sleep, but I don’t know much. Also, my Fitbit (not sure how accurate it is) seems to reflect mild-moderate OSA based on the number of arousals, and like the PSG it shows no desats.

I won't find out more results until 3 weeks or so. \n\nAnother thing is is that as far as I know and with questions I asked my previous partner (we were together for 10 years) is that he said that I didn't snore and he never noticed that I stop breathing in my sleep and was a heavy sleeper and I trust his word. \n\nMy partner after him was different, initially he constantly complained that I was snoring would hit me to wake me constantly. Then later he would gradually get angry if I even tried to take a nap or go to bed early and would guilt me into staying up with him. If I even went to sleep he would deliberately make a lot of noise, slam doors, have the TV really loud, etc. This went on for about 2 years until I wised up and left.\n\n That was about 3 years ago and these past 3 years I've had nothing BUT sleep problems.

udu6b7,1651149990,Sudden sleep apnea over the past week?,"Hi, I realize this may not be the place to post this, but I don’t know where else to. Basically, as of last Thursday, I’ve been getting terrible sleep and some consistent and odd symptoms. I normally sleep 7-8 hours and feel great after. Anyway, whats been happening may have been building up for some time. I’ve noticed recently that I had been sleeping in a certain position to prevent my mouth from opening at night, and ive since been sleeping with good posture. I also feel its worth noting that I have a harder time breathing through my nose than mouth most of the time, always have but not bad enough to cause this. Heres whats been happening: I’ll go to bed, lie there, feel like I’m falling asleep, and then right at the point of sleep it feels like my throat is closing up? This started after Thursday night, wherein I fell asleep normally but then woke up only 2 hours later with my heart racing, a super dry throat and short of breath. I told my reg doc about it, he seems to think it’s anxiety and gerd related (I recently quit weed and quit caffeine even more recently) but I don’t really buy it. I’ve recently raised the head end of my bed 6 inches, which eliminated gerd as it doesn’t bother me at night and normally never does. I’m going in about 30 minutes to a different doc for a 2nd opinion. Every time ive woken up this week, without fail, it’s earlier than I want to with a racing heart and shortness of breath, and my throat feels like the Sahara. What’s strange to me is how suddenly it seems like this started happening. I may have tried to change too many things at once because I used to go to bed much later than when I have been, but that doesn’t explain why I’m having the short breath and racing heart when waking. What do you guys think? Sleep apnea? I don’t really snore. I’ve noticed when I push my lower jaw forward while laying down it makes breathing easier, and I used to sleep in a certain way to put my jaw in a position for that. But there were plenty of times I didn’t and still slept fine (or at least i think i did). I’m sorry for the essay, but I’m at my wits end here!

I've had the Luna II CPAP machine for about 6 months and each night I try and use it I can't stay asleep for more than 2 hours. I sleep a bit longer without the machine, but still not getting good sleep due to the sleep apnea. I went to see my ENT who prescribed the CPAP and found out the Luna II used auto pressure rather than a specific pressure prescribed for me. She said I would have to do an in house sleep study to get that specific pressure, but it wasn't worth it since my sleep apnea is mild. I had even changed from a pillow mask for the nasal mask since the pillow mask would easily come loose and leak, but it's still not working for me. I've read here and in other forums that for people that don't sleep well with CPAP it can take time to adjust, but I've been trying for 6 months and haven't had any improvement. My ENT recommended trying myTAP mouth guard, but when I was first diagnosed that's what they recommended, but my insurance wouldn't cover it and I'm worried that they still won't and I still can't afford it out of pocket. I'm also worried that won't work either and I'll keep having chronic insomnia.

I was almost positive something would show up - as both nights I woke up multiple times like I always do, and dealt with the same daytime sleepinesses I deal with daily.\n\nI’m sure my doctor will discuss next steps when I see him, but I’m curious what others have done, or if there are questions/recommendations you can make.\n\nThanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/ubqoi1/home_sleep_study_results_show_normal_whats_next/
uboo3g,1650902877,Possible to prevent cheeks from puffing out?,This has been my biggest challenge with cpap. With a nasal mask I can keep my mouth shut with a chin strap and mouth tape but my tongue drops and allows air into my mouth puffing out my cheeks like a hamster and drying out my mouth. I tried a full face mask that cradles under the nostrils and if I mouth breathe it puffs out my mouth. Is it even possible to avoid that? I know the whole point of cpap is to displace soft tissue so if there's anyone that mouth breathes while they sleep do they just deal with that?,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/uboo3g/possible_to_prevent_cheeks_from_puffing_out/
ubodok,1650902164,4th night on BiPAP questions,"I’m on my 4th night of using my BiPAP machine for sleep apnea. The problem i don’t understand is my prescription says I have a diagnostic AHI of 6.0 and an RDI of 13.1. My first night on my CPAP the machine told me my AHI was 10.6, then 9.6 the next night, then 9.5 and now 8.5. It’s going down but it’s still saying my AHI is higher than my diagnostic AHI?? Shouldn’t I see a more significant reduction pretty quick if not immediately?

ublsw1,1650895157,Possible sleep apnea,"I think my partner might have sleep apnea but I'm not sure? If he does have it, it's so mild that he doesn't have very many events. He doesn't wake up gasping and doesn't normally have headaches. I only think he could have it because sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I can hear him breathing, or struggling to exhale as it were.\n\nMy partner is a heavy snorer. I can usually track his breathing pattern very easily as a result. But on rare occasions, I wake up to hear him inhaling, and then nothing. It's like he's holding all that air inside his mouth, and refuses to let it out. And then, ever so slowly, a hiss of air will escape. Or else it'll be suddenly expelled in a bwoosh, and then the pattern repeats itself. He doesn't sound like he's gasping for air, more like having difficulty exhaling.\n\nWe have no idea how often this happens. By my tracking, it's only happened a handful of times since we started sleeping together - which is like 5 years at this point? But I'm also a heavy sleeper who can usually sleep through his most thunderous snores. It's only on rare occasions that I'm either still awake while he's asleep, or I wake up in the middle of the night.\n\nAlso relevant, his mother has sleep apnea and sleeps with a CPAP. My partner himself is overweight but he's lost a good chunk of it already. In fact, the second last time I witnessed an event was before he made an appointment with a dietician to start properly losing weight. I thought it was going well, but a couple of nights ago, I woke up to the sound of him having difficulty exhaling again.\n\nIs this sleep apnea? Is there something I can do? Are we already on the right track with the weight loss, since it doesn't seem so serious? Or is it just something similar but not quite the same? Any advice would help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/ublsw1/possible_sleep_apnea/

ube9a0,1650866809,Strong suspicion of having something not unlike sleep apnea,"I am a twenty-year-old male currently in my third year of university, and I have suspicions that I have something, sleep apnea or otherwise, that is interfering with my ability to breathe/get restful sleep and causing all sorts of concomitant mental and cognitive dysfunction.\n\nSince not too long after high school graduation, I have often been waking up feeling short of breath and as if my brain had literally not been supplied with adequate oxygen, with this general short-breathedness persisting, albeit in a much more subtle way, throughout the day. I am always yawning and often feel like I have to force myself to breathe deeper due to my unconscious, reflexive breathing not intaking enough oxygen, and my cardio is dreadful despite my seemingly fit exterior. I had asthma as a child, and have a litany of other health issues, i.e., my body is fairly defective and it would not surprise me if there were some additional issues lurking such as sleep apnea. \n\nFrequently, as I am passing into sleep, my brain seems to forget to breath, which jolts me awake, gasping for air. This never happens as I am waking, so I am not sure of the significance of this. I also frequently wake up in the midst of a dream, which I have also connected with daytime grogginess. \n\nAlmost every day of my college career, even after having gotten enough sleep (If I sleep less than 8 hours, I might as well consider the day finished as soon as it starts), I find myself groggily trudging through the day, my faculties refusing to cooperate with the simple demands I ask of them, and struggling to focus on anything other than my constant brain-fog. Barely having the attention span, motivation, and mental clarity to direct me to my responsibilities in a satisfactory manner, my academic performance has suffered and I've been increasingly content with mediocrely squeaking by my classes. Interestingly, the only moments of clarity--when I am actually able to direct myself to cognitively demanding tasks without being zapped by a spell of confusion--come late in the night during surges of mania--like my body literally takes the entire day to wake. This leads to another parallel development, with symptoms of Bipolar disorder, for which I was briefly and unsuccessfully medicated, unfolding through the same span of time--though I am not familiar of any possible connection between Bipolar disorder and sleep apnea.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/ube9a0/strong_suspicion_of_having_something_not_unlike/
ubdn7y,1650864415,Phillips Replacement Arrived but having issues...,"So before I get too far into this I want to preface it by saying that I know I am extremely fortunate and many of you are still waiting on any kind of replacement. I'm not trying to sound whiny or ungrateful but just trying to figure this out.\n\nLast summer I registered my device with Phillips and was told to just stop using it. I immediately called my doctor because my sleep apnea is so severe, I stopped breathing over 100 times in an hour during my sleep study. He sent over an order and I got a new resmed to use instead. I've been using it since and while I like Phillips better, it's been a good solution. \n\nAbout 3 weeks ago I got an email that my Phillips replacement was on the way. It got delivered with instructions on how to send my Phillips machine back. I've been trying to set it up and followed all instructions but it will not use my settings. My pressure should be 17 but it only goes to 4. I've moved over the SD card and modem from my old machine. I've let it sit for 30 minutes (they suggest 5) to sync and no luck. If it was a small difference, I'd just roll with it but 4 is not going to help me. \n\nThis isn't a huge deal right now. My old Phillips was paid for and insurance is paying for my resmed so I intend to keep the replacement Phillips just as a back up and maybe use it when traveling but I want to get it working before I ship the one I paid for back.\n\nAny suggestions? I don't want to have to go to the dme provider because they are horrible to deal with. \n\nAgain, sorry to those who are still waiting.

uad7wq,1650743130,Questions About Clear Airway Apneas,"I’ve have been using an AirSense11 Autoset with an AirFit F20 Full Face Mask for 6 months. I was diagnosed with Mild-Moderate Obstructive sleep apnea although I think it is mostly Mild. My AHI is typically less than 1.0, but with frequent AHIs of 2-3, which consist of clusters of Clear Airway apneas (e.g., 18 within an hour) usually in the two-hour period before I get up.  My obstructive apneas are mostly gone.\n\nOn apneaboard.com, a definition was provided: “Sleep-Wake-Junk - Clusters of apnea and hypopnea events concentrated mainly around periods of sleep-wake transition. In general Sleep-wake-junk (SWJ) is not regarded as ""real"" since they do not occur during periods of sleep, but may be during semi-awake periods or ""dozing"".\n\n**First question**: Does my body respond to these CA apneas the same as OA apneas: wakes me up with adrenaline? After a cluster of CAs, I’m usually wide awake and often have to go to the bathroom. Lately, I’ve been getting up and sleeping in a chair in my bedroom (usually during the last hr. of my normal sleep time). \n\n**Second question**: If my problem is poor sleep, should I stop worrying about the CA apneas and quit trying to reduce them (e.g., by changing the EPR value)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/uad7wq/questions_about_clear_airway_apneas/

uaailb,1650735231,Are these symptoms of sleep apnea or just general bad hygiene,"Hey guys,  \n\nSo here is the thing, it's been a while now that i have a poor sleep schedule, during the days i work from home, i would sleep at 1am 2am, wake up at 9h30/10h00am, around 12pm 13pm, i'd eat lunch, masturbate, then feel sleepy as hell, then i would sleep for an hour, maybe two if i don't have a meeting.  \n\nOn weekends, i can have a planning, like studying for a certificate i have in a few months. When i wake up in the morning, as soon as i take breakfast, i feel sleepy again. It is really frustrating. It happened to me today, so what i did was take a walk instead of getting back to bed, and it worked. However as soon as i took lunch, i felt sleepy, go to bed, curtains down, masturbate, then slept for 2 hours...  \n\nWhat makes me think this is not due to Sleep Apnea but just due to being at my house and masturbating too much, it is that when i'm at my workplace, i don't feel any of these symptoms, except tiredness after lunch but that goes away pretty fast and doesn't prevent me from working.  \n\nSomething about the possibility that  can just leave my desk at home, go to bed, masturbate and sleep, makes me instantly unmotivated and sleepy, it is really physical.  \n\nSo should i bother with a diagnosis or just change my life hygiene, masturbate only late at night before sleep, and try maintaining a coherent and constant sleep schedule?  \n\nAlso, i'm that type of person who don't feel sleepy at night, like from 18pm to 2am i'm pretty alert, but i struggle with not sleeping in the afternoon after lunch. Are people with sleep apnea supposed to be always tired? Because i'm litterally not always tired, it's just that i have a messed up sleep schedule.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/uaailb/are_these_symptoms_of_sleep_apnea_or_just_general/
ua9wgh,1650733421,Can we talk about apneaboard.com?,"So, I've been sitting on this for three years and some events happened recently that made me decide to finally make a post about it. I'm posting it here because I can't post it there (see issue #1 below) and I see apneaboard.com recommended a lot here, it's even a link in the sidebar. I'm not sure if there on mods on this subreddit that are also mods over there, but if so, I fully expect this post to be removed even though it doesn't break any rules of the subreddit. There are two major issues that I wanted to bring up:\n\n1. The mods at apneaboard.com run the forum like an authoritarian country; it is sleep apnea North Korea, and *any* type of dissent is crushed immediately. If you don't agree with the mods 100% of the time on any topic, your post is getting removed.\n2. **Your password is exposed to the entire Internet every time you log in to the site.**\n\nI was diagnosed with sleep apnea in 2019, and after getting my machine I was dissatisfied with the lack of data I got from the manufacturer's application. That led me to Sleepyhead/OSCAR, which led me to apneaboard.com.\n\nAfter signing up for an account at the forum, I noticed that they don't have HTTPS enabled; this is a *very bad thing* for a site that requires a login. HTTPS is a secure version of the HTTP protocol. When you visit an HTTPS website, all of the traffic between your computer and that website is encrypted and completely unreadable by any third-party between you and the website. If you log in to a website and HTTPS isn't enabled, **your password is exposed in plain text** along the entire path from your computer to that website. Depending on where you are located geographically in relation to the website, your traffic can go through a significant number of third-party networks before finally arriving at the destination, and each hop along that path is another entity that sees your password. When you combine this with people's tendency to reuse passwords, you haven't just exposed your password for a sleep apnea forum, you've also exposed that password (or a simple variation of it) for everything else that you use that password for. ([Tip: Use a unique password for everything and use a password manager to store all of those passwords.](https://bitwarden.com))\n\nThis is a *really* concerning issue, but it's a *very simple* issue to fix, [so I sent a message to the main mod about it](https://i.imgur.com/48Mn1Fa.png) and even offered to help them fix it. After a while, [I received a response to the message](https://i.imgur.com/unJwNwz.png) laying out concerns about users posting images, and I explained in my reply that no matter which action is taken, even inaction, that the problems highlighted would occur and that there's really no reason not to turn on HTTPS for login.\n\nNext, [I sent another message](https://i.imgur.com/LjCsrsY.png) showing exactly how to at least let users log in via an encrypted connection even if access to the rest of the site is left unencrypted and insecure. In that message, I also included a packet capture that clearly showed my password being exposed in plain text when logging in to the website. As a reminder, this password is exposed for the entire path from my computer to the Apnea Board website. I did not receive any further private message replies after this.\n\nWhile this private message thread was happening, [I created a new thread in the Off-Topic forum to test the fix that I sent the mod in the private message and successfully made a few posts using an HTTPS connection](https://i.imgur.com/joPuVw9.png). After seeing that what I suggested actually works, the mod posted an incredibly snarky, defensive, and patently incorrect reply that demonstrates their lack of knowledge on the topic and then locked the thread. They left the thread up long enough for me to see it, and then deleted the thread entirely.\n\nWhile I'm thinking about it, I haven't mentioned their [""Is this a secure website?"" misinformation thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20200511072229/http://www.apneaboard.com/forums/Thread-Admin-Note-Is-ApneaBoard-com-a-SECURE-website) at all, which, impressively, will leave the reader *less informed* on the topic than before they had the misfortune of reading that page. There has since been a snarky reply made to that thread telling users how to sign in with an HTTPS connection *if you really really want to*, but you have to be signed in to the website to read that post in the first place, so at that point, your password has already been compromised.\n\nI left it alone after that and made no further efforts on the subject.\n\nAnd then unrelated on-topic posts that I'd made started disappearing. I'd had enough at this point and just didn't participate at all, because apparently I'd been blackballed for having the audacity to suggest that you shouldn't expose 90,000 people's passwords to the Internet. I forgot about it and didn't visit the site for a few years.\n\nI came back a couple days ago to browse and see if they ever fixed the issue (spoiler alert: they didn't) and started browsing around the forums. I saw some pretty disturbing shit on the Off-Topic forum and posted a thread about it, which, shocker, was removed without explanation. A few days later I made [a new thread asking why it was removed](https://i.imgur.com/5z4CGQ3.png), and again, shocker, that thread was removed. I mean, really, what the fuck.\n\nHas anyone else had this sort of experience there? I understand the need for strong moderation, but the way it's currently being run is reminiscent of the USSR under Stalin. Why is this site recommended so often, especially seeing as how they **clearly** don't care about their users' security? If you have an account at apneaboard.com and you reuse passwords, you should change your password at those other services **right now**, because it *has* been exposed. And also just stop reusing passwords altogether, but that's beside the point.\n\nI don't know. My entire experience with that site has left a really sour taste in my mouth and I don't feel like there's a good alternative to it aside from cpaptalk.com, which doesn't have as much traffic. I think I'm done with it altogether.\n\nPlease change your passwords.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/ua9wgh/can_we_talk_about_apneaboardcom/

In short, for the past almost 3 years, I've suffered daily headaches upon waking up, brain fog, inability to focus, chronic fatigue, chronically high hemoglobin, just completely feeling like a zombie 24/7...it's gotten to the point where I'm 5 weeks away from graduating college and considering dropping the quarter to figure out what is going on with me because I've missed so much class due to this. I literally feel like my brain is completely off and I'm always on autopilot. My final straw was waking up gasping for air in my dorm and always having nightmares about suffocating plus constant shortness of breath. It was so bad that I moved back home because I didn't wanna be alone in my dorm dealing with all of this. I guess I didn't see a sleep specialist sooner cuz I was seeing these other doctors such as hematologists and such but no one could ever find the problem. I also don't really fit the criteria as a 22M who's fit. I did break my nose when I was younger so I'm not sure if that is contributing. I opt-ed to do the in-lab study, but I think I'd rather do the at-home study since it's more comfortable and I think I can do it sooner. The only thing is, I'm not sure how accurate it would be. The doctor said It would only detect severe cases of sleep apnea and I'm not sure where I lie on the severity scale, if it is sleep apnea. With my severe symptoms, I'm convinced the at-home test would detect it. What was your guys' experience and do you regret the way you got tested?

The little information I could find from my study shows that the doctor who read my report is suggesting ""Auto PAP"", which I basically understand after doing some research as a machine that figures out the correct pressure levels for you.\n\nFirst of all, I've seen a fair bit of mention of BiPAP machines, which can help with exhaling by lowering pressure so you don't have to fight against the incoming air (something I'm worried about). First of all, are Auto PAP and BiPAP mutually exclusive? Can you get a machine that automatically adjusts itself while also providing lighter exhale pressures?\n\nSecondly, planning on going to the ENT for this, not seeking a diagnosis here, but I very frequently run into a situation in bed where one of my two nostrils is almost fully blocked. Like, I can try to blow it hard and some air and liquid mucus will come out (apologies for the gross details) but I can't really inhale through it without pulling very hard, and even then it's almost no air. It's usually the same nostril but occasionally it switches. My question is--is this the kind of thing that is serious enough to impact my success when using PAP or could it theoretically affect the type of PAP machine I should get?

u7dnzz,1650397416,Inspire,I’ve been dealing with severe apnea for several years now. I was cpap intolerant and have had one surgery so far (hyoid suspension) with little relief. My numbers hover between 70 and 95 episodes per hour. I’ve been fighting the insurance company for over two years in attempt to get the Inspire device approved. The max episodes for approval are 65 at this time. Even one test resulted in 68 episodes which was still denied. The percentages of obstructive vs central fall in the proper range. Any advice on bringing the total numbers down? Anyone else fought this fight successfully? Any advice is appreciated. Working on dropping some weight now just so I can be approved for another sleep study (I’ve done over 15 to date). Thanks in advance!,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/u7dnzz/inspire/
u7bpbl,1650392255,Less sleep but I feel better. Sleep Apnea related?,"Hi There, \n\nI'm not sure if I have sleep apnea or not, but I'm on a wait list for an at home test. I'm hoping it can explain why I feel so crappy on a daily basis, irritable, terrible memory, etc. I'm getting treated for depression although things aren't improving as fast as I'd like.\n\nAnyways, normally I have a really hard time waking up in the morning. I have this sense of irritability that lasts throughout the day. Some days, maybe once every few weeks, I feel refreshed and calm throughout the whole day. Like my memory is much better and I can actually hold a conversation. It feels like I have a break from the brain fog and anxiety. Today seems to be one of those odd good days so I'm trying to find out what's different. My sleep was unusual today - I woke up a lot of times throughout the night, tossing and turning, waking up and remembering waking up many times. It was like I barely slept but for some reason this made the waking up process easier as it felt like I was in bed for a while. I think my sleep was the main difference from other days where I feel crappy. However, waking up many times should make me feel worse. Not sure if I usually wake up in the night but at least I dont remember. Maybe I avoided a certain phase of sleep or something I'm not sure. \n\nDoes this sound like it could possibly be sleep apnea related from your experience? It's almost like I didn't sleep at all but I feel way better than usual. It sounds counterintuitive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/u7bpbl/less_sleep_but_i_feel_better_sleep_apnea_related/

I’m going to give another cpap machine again. Any recommendations when dealing with Gerd, allergies, and sleep apnea? I have a humidifier, I have tired antihistamines, but stopped because I felt it made the sleep anpea worse. My anxiety and depression.

u6vvbe,1650340101,Differential diagnosis experiences?,"I’ve heard many, many people mention that the first few weeks/months of CPAP can be awful because of the adjustment period.

The first two nights I did struggle with the fit and air leakage and couldn’t fall asleep easily. Found out after that my mask is a great fit, 0 leakage 90% of the night. I knock out almost immediately after putting it on. I find myself waking up 3-5 hours into my sleep now, when this didn’t occur before.\n\nAHI sits around 0.0 to 0.5. OSCAR shows no events. I posted on apneaboard.com and adjusted my machine’s settings as per someone’s recommendation, and found virtually no difference in how I feel. They suggested I use it for a week but it’s been two days so I don’t plan on discontinuing usage yet. Used a Wellue O2 monitor and imported that data as well, but no drops below 96% after falling asleep, avg. of 99%.\n\nI do plan on getting another opinion (did the sleep study at home), but I’m not scheduled for a few weeks. They mentioned that it might be worth getting a differential diagnosis. I do have some narcolepsy-like symptoms including fatigue that worsens when inactive, and after I started using APAP I dream as I fall asleep and wake up from movements related to my dreams, but I don’t remember much about those dreams. I also struggle to sleep since I get anxious about all the things I didn’t accomplish during the day which I spent dozing off instead. Prescribed ADHD meds and taking 400mg caffeine a day for migraines but stimulants never had much of an effect on fatigue in general.

u6me1o,1650312924,"first time poster, very likely I have sleep apnea","I visited the Dr for my chronic fatigue that just seems to be getting worse and worse.  After having several other medical conditions ruled out my Dr. Ordered a sleep study (at home). I am waiting for it to arrive.  For some reason this never seemed to be a possibility to me because I don't snore often (according to my husband) I am young, exercise frequently for long periods of time (consistent half marathon runner for over 10 years) , and not over weight.  However, this did make me remember why I stopped sleeping on my back about 13 years ago during my first pregnancy-I would stop breathing in my sleep and it freaked me out. As an avid runner, I wear my Garmin watch while I sleep and have been looking at my O2 levels-it dropped down to its lowest point at 76% saturation last night and at times I would only breathe 6 times per minute.  I have a naturally low resting heart rate of about 56 but my heart rate in my sleep averages 63 (not a significant difference). I also knowingly wake about 3 time per night to use the restroom, and countless other times I turn over in bed briefly.  I think it is extremely likely that I have sleep apnea.  I have many concerns with the treatment.  It seems the first choice of treatment is CPAP.  I honestly cannot imagine sleeping with something sticking up my nose or blowing.  I also have OCD and am extremely sensitive about sensory things especially when I am trying to sleep.  I cannot have my skin touching itself, and I can't even stand if my own breath is bouncing back in my face if a blanket or something is nearby.  I have a whole sleep routine I have to do if I want to sleep. \n\nI am also seeing ""travel"" cpap machines and I'm wondering if they might be smaller and quieter, for everyday use?  I can't tell if they are sufficient to be used in a stand alone situation.  I do travel a lot (which causes tons od sleep issues as well.... But I love it).

I'm wondering if modafinil would be a good alternative treatment to my sleep apnea, or if it's not even a good idea to take with my heart murmur. ty &lt;3\n\n\nhi!! 19 year old here with sleep apnea, I had it as a baby and it kind of fizzled out and I thought I had gotten over it until I moved in with my boyfriend.  He wakes me up multiple times a night because I've stopped breathing.  \nSo of course, I really need to do something about this.  But I'm 19.. the LAST thing I want is to be using a sleep machine at this age.  Also considering the fact we're about to be traveling the country in a van in the next few months, having a CPAP machine sounds less than ideal..\n\nSo I've started researching medications used to treat sleep apnea and I read a lot about Modafinil.  It sounds (from what I've read) like that's one of the best medications to treat sleep apnea.  But I'm a little worried, because I also have a heart murmur, and Modafinil gives some side effects like increased heart rate and others, so it makes me a little nervous to take.\n\nNow I know, this is a question for my doctor, and I will definitely talk to her about my concerns, but I also wanted the opinions of people who might have actually taken it themselves too!  Because I often feel like my concerns are kind of just brushed off at the doctors office, and they just throw medications at me all the time without reason.\n\nSo any input on if this is something I should or should NOT be taking?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/u4kqik/modafinil/

u4j1bn,1650060304,“I think everyone has at little bit of sleep apnea”,"Recently got diagnosed with mild REM-based sleep apnea via the Lofta at-home test. Sleep has always been a problem for me - many, many people have talked about how restless I am and how loud I snore and groan/moan in my sleep. I feel so tired during the day, even with 400mg caffeine and dextroamphetamine multiple times throughout the day. Started CPAP this week and even though I feel more tired, I don’t move around much anymore and I’m optimistic about it.\n\nI’ve also been seeing an ENT for allergy-like symptoms that aren’t really allergies and he wants me to do a nasal procedure for my turbinates. I know it’ll help my breathing in general, but after recording my snoring with and without nasal spray, my snoring was even clearer since I’d still breathe through my mouth. I exercise, eat healthily, weigh &lt; 100lbs and feel that I’m not taken that seriously by doctors when talking about my sleep issues. But my ADHD, Bipolar, PMS and migraines cause debilitating symptoms and poor sleep quality makes all of this noticeably worse.\n\nRegarding the title, that’s a quote from my ENT. He brushed it off when I told him the test was positive and repeatedly told me “I’ve never seen a sleep study show up negative”. It felt really invalidating, and I’m kind of wary of telling my PCP since she didn’t even think an ENT was necessary for my symptoms. I just wanted to vent a bit and I’d be interested in hearing if anyone else has had similar experiences.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/u4j1bn/i_think_everyone_has_at_little_bit_of_sleep_apnea/

I wanted to share an embarrassing event that happened to me last night in the hope that someone can provide me with some insight.\n\nTL;DR: I had an accident in bed the night after my titration study\n\nA month or so ago, I was diagnosed with moderate to severe sleep apnea based on an at-home study.  Finally the night before last, I went for my titration test. I haven't heard anything official back one way or the other yet but I think it went well.  The mask stayed on and I was able to adjust to wearing it without too much difficulty.  Also I vividly remember a dream that I had in the middle of the night. This is something that almost never happens to me so I took it as a good sign that I got some quality REM sleep while I was attached to the CPAP machine.  \n\nYesterday, the day after the night of the study, I was extremely tired and ended up taking two naps.  Even so I went to bed last night at my usual time and slept... better than usual I would say.  I didn't wake up at 3 AM which is unusual for me.  As I drifted in to and out of wakefulness in the morning, I suddenly noticed that the bed was wet. That's right, I wet the bed. :(.  I have no history of incontinence. This has never happened to me before (well, not since I was 3!). \n\nObviously, I find this alarming. It has to be related to the sleep study the night before right?

The rest of my life, I’ve slept from around 11 to 8 and felt like garbage constantly and taken naps frequently.\n\nHowever, the past few couple of weeks, I’ve been going to sleep around 11, and I have been naturally waking up at 5 and just getting out of bed and feeling great. I cut caffeine out of my life a while ago, but I do take Vyvanse. I also have been getting a little bit of regular exercise (at least 30 minutes a day, at least 15 in the cardio + vigorous exercise HR zones) because I can actually recover from it now. I will talk with my Dr about it in a few weeks, but I’m curious if y’all think:\n\n1. It’s the Vyvanse’s fault (I take it around 7 even if I wake up a bit early and it doesn’t tend to keep me awake at night, so I don’t see how), and I need to reduce dosage probably. I’m already thinking of doing that because I’m worried about long term effects on my heart and I’m hoping I don’t need as much of it now that I have a CPAP.\n2.

But after a sleep assessment two months ago I was told I have mild-moderate obstructive sleep apnea.  \n\n\nIn a search to find out why this has come about, I went to an ear, nose and throat doctor (ENT), who has informed me that my sleep apnea issues are due to nasal obstruction. He says I have enlarged/disfigured nasal turbinates and that I require surgery (septoplasty/turbinate reduction). Unfortunately the waiting list is potentially up to 12 months and he didn't really provide any information on how to manage/treat my sleeping issues in the meantime.   \n\n\nI thought I would write in here to see if any of you had any suggestions on what I can do in the meantime for some relief? Apart from general remedies such as saline spray etc., is there anything else anyone recommends I try? My quality of sleep is bad - Im waking up multiple times in the night, and I'd love to get a full night's sleep for the first time in a while.   \n\n\nWould a CPAP machine help in this circumstance?

I ll eventually do the nose operation anyways but right now I am at the pressure setting phase of starting cpap. Does anyone think that fixing the nose could have sorted my apnea problem?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/u3bgfg/conflicting_doctor_suggestions/
u3a9u0,1649915070,Sleep Study Results,"Hi all,\n\nI just received my sleep study results and I have an AHI of 70 and my O2 dipped below 50% at one point. The study was not supposed to be a split, but my O2 was so bad they hooked me up to a CPAP halfway through. On CPAP average O2 was 97% with a low of 88%. I also did not have any REM sleep off of CPAP, but had nearly 30% REM sleep while on it.\n\nI now know why I’ve felt so awful for the last few years. It’s scary, but I’m looking forward to feeling better soon. Though I can’t sleep for the life of me now that I know how bad my sleep is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/u3a9u0/sleep_study_results/

u3a3hl,1649914346,Apnea Caused By Congestion,"Recently diagnosed for sleep apnea. Moderate severity at the moment, but the impact on my life has been huge. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyhow, I noticed that I feel congested at least 60 - 70% of each day, and it often gets worse when I lay down. I finally received the CPAP machine I ordered, and after a few days of trying to use it, honestly it feels terrible. The feeling of wearing a cpap when you have congestion actually feels far worse than trying to sleep without it, and so far I've not made it more than 45 mins of wearing it, and have 0 desire to try the cpap again. It feels like suffocation. \n\nI'm thinking I'll only try it again after I've addressed the congestion. I do have a nasal spray : oxymetazoline, and it works beautifully within 5 minutes of spraying.  \n\nIt lasts about 4 - 5 hours, and I'd love to rely on that for my congestion, but my research tells me it should only be used sparingly. So I'm wondering what others have used to get rid of the chronic congestion?  \n\nWon't have access to the sleep center again for at least a few months - Once I wrap up this current project I'll be able to continue with a doc. But in the meantime, really need some relief here. The non-stop congestion is really making everything far worse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/u3a3hl/apnea_caused_by_congestion/
u3a0bw,1649913994,Struggling with my sensory sensitivities. can’t stand the way it feels touching my skin,"I am at 60 days. I was struggling to make more than 1-3 hours. Then, miraculously, i had my first whole nights sleep. It was AMAZING! I hoped it was for forever but alas, it was not. However my new average is 4 hours which is so awesome because that’s the minimum for compliance, 70% of the time (AFAIK). Sometimes i get 5-6. \n\nI’ve ALWAYS struggled with sleep- bit of a ‘princess and the pea’, diagnosed insomnia since at least 14. I have extreme sensory sensitivities so I’m a very light sleeper. Sounds, textures, temperature, air flow, pressure and weights of blankets and pillows, thirst… these are the things that consistently disrupt my sleep.\nI have used the p30i nasal pillow, the f30i full face mask, the n30i cushion and the dreamwear cushion. Currently alternate between n30i cushion and dreamwear cushion with a resmed chin strap. Both masks have the little soft wraps on the side and generally are fairly comfy but the plastic that touches my nose makes my skin feel clammy and wakes me up. Any mask. \n\nThe other thing is sometimes i can mitigate it by loosening up my mask but that only works for back sleeping and ri go back and forth to side. \n\nHere’s your bonus point reading piece if you made it this far. the worst part is ever since i was a little girl, i can’t sleep without the weight of a pillow over my head positioned so that it’s over my head ears and eyes (along with eye mask). All my masks have the tub coming out of the top of my head so that it’s easier to switch from back to side. I have to position the pillow over my head just right so it doesn’t amplify the sound of the air coming out the top of my head, but also the pillow pulls on my mask and causes leaks so it has to be tighter which means it’s touching my skin more in ways i don’t like. \n\nI’ve tried to get this small eye weight pillow thing but it wasn’t big enough. Might eventually try to make something but I’m not there yet. Anyway this is really overwhelming and I’m struggling and hate it if it wasn’t obvious. Just posting on the off chance i get that random nugget of perfect advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/u3a0bw/struggling_with_my_sensory_sensitivities_cant/

I was diagnosed with SA with an AHI of 95.\n\nI wasn't a dumb child growing up, but I believe my cognitive speed and attentive capacity have both decreased as a result of severe sleep apnea. I've seen research studies on the effects of SA on brain function, which makes me quite concerned because I rely on my brain to work in highly technical domains. In comparison to healthy folks, I don't feel as bright or as mindless.\n\nHas anyone of you seen an improvement in your mental clarity and confidence?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/u39a24/how_long_will_we_be_able_to_recover_from_brain/
