I’ll let the Dr. Make that call, but personally would rather accept the pain and stay away from Prednisone if it doesn’t help slow the progression of the disease. I’ll obviously accept taking other medications used to treat RA and take on the side affects, but doesn’t seem worth it to take on prednisone sides if it only helps manage pain. \n\nMaybe I sound crazy, my pain levels reach close to 8/9 of 10 when flaring, but hate the thought of any meds at my age (28 otherwise healthy male).",https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/ue0dxn/prednisone_always_prescribed/

udg3o6,1651099582,My RA story/rant as a college student (22F),"Hello everyone!! I never really used reddit before, until about a month ago-ish when i was kinda going through it mentally and wanted some support after everything I’ve been going through.\n\nAnyway, i got covid and the flu back in late September, asymptomatic and vaccinated. Then about mid to late October, i started getting some swelling, redness, and warmth in my knuckles that i just assumed was from overworking them in my art classes. Pains got progressively worse and also advanced to my wrists, ankles, and shoulders. I didn’t tell my parents anything or go to the doctor until late December. I tested positive for Lyme disease. Took antibiotics and Celebrex all January and February. My physician put in a referral with the infectious disease doctor. My parents got impatient and took me to the ER at the hospital he works at so that we could hopefully see him quicker. The ER doctor got in contact with him and my physician. The infectious disease doctor said that i took enough antibiotics to fight off the Lyme disease and i was experiencing something else. My physician let the ER doctor know that in my original DECEMBER bloodwork i also had VERY high rheumatoid levels. ER doctor started me on HCQ and gave me prescription for methylprednisolone (dose pack). My older sister is a medical assistant and got me an appointment with a rheumatologist just about a week after that ER visit (very grateful). He continued me on HCQ and an “as needed” prescription for methylprednisolone. Currently, I’m on month two of HCQ and week two of methotrexate and still taking methylprednisolone as needed.\n\nMy pain levels are usually between 6-7 in the mornings and level out to about a 2-4 in the evenings. Is that normal/consistent with RA?\n\nAlso since the beginning, i now have pain in most of my joints i.e. fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders, KNEES, ankles, and toes. I use a heating pad and various gels and ointments that my parents make me try. I also use compression gloves bc my hands hurt a lot in the morning. \n\nI withdrew from the semester, dont have a job, never really socialized too much to begin with soooo my mental health is kind of deteriorating.

udcxha,1651091047,What helps while waiting for first appointment?,"My ostepath referred me to a Rheumatologist, who has confirmed the diagnosis.  The Rheumatologist can't see me until July 6th.  Over the past week or so, the pain and fatigue seem to be escalating.  I have no apatite.  Fasting blood glucose from my last Physical was 112, and subsequent blood panels showed elevated.  Fairly certain I'm dealing with pre-diabites. \n\n I've been on Diclofenac twice daily (75mg) and it's doing nothing anymore.  I told this to the osteopath, they prescribed me mobic. \n\nMy pain varies in degree, but recently it's spending a lot of time at the max level -- which is not entirely unbearable, the fatigue and brain fog are my biggest issue. \n\nI've changed my eating to follow a Mediterranean (when I eat).  The only supplements I'm trying are simple multivitamin and vitamin D -- as I have a history of very low vitamin D. \n\nTL;DR: What are the best options for a person in the situation of confirmed diagnosis, but unable to get on meds for while for each of the following? \n\n1) Compression gloves?\n\nI'm using fingerless compression gloves, and they seem to help a bit.  I'm using the ""copper infused"" gloves. I don't put any stock in the ""copper infusion"" doing crap, but the compression does seem to help. \n\n2) Specific foods or lifestyle changes to avoid or eat/do  more of? \n\nI cut out alcohol back in February, and I'm not a smoker (except for occasionally Delta 8 which is the only legal THC in my state).  When I can I go on short walks, and do some VR exercises.  Lately though, I just feel like I have a mild(ish) flue most days, and I'm just more and more worn down. \n\n3) Supplements/non-prescription stimulants? \n\nI've seen a few mentions of people using stimulants to counter the fatigue. I have no experience with these beyond caffeine, and various ""pre-workout"" drinks.  Is this even something worth considering? I would be concerned it would just cause me to crash even harder. \n\n4) OTC topicals: are any of them any good? \n\nThere are ton of creams and such. Does anyone actually get benefit from \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5) I'm really struggling with exercise. \n\nI used to be a marathon runner.  I started having unexplained fatigue that would show up randomly and make a formerly easy run near impossible.  I kept trying to push through, but that just led me to be more exhausted. \n\nSince I have anxiety and depression plus RA, I'm not sure how to gauge when to push and when not to. When I was a runner, I had simple rule ""if it feels like injury warning, back off now. Otherwise, push. Hard"".    I would usually get my second or third wind, or at least stabilize at a level of fatigue.\n\nIt's different now.  The fatigue just feels different. My legs just feel ""dead"" like I would experience  the day after a 20 mile run.  I'm scared to push here. It doesn't feel like depression fatigue either. \n\nIs there anyway other than straight-up trial an error I can judge when to stop and when to push? Obviously, if I'm having joint pain I'll stop, but aside from that? It just feels like I'm doing the most exhausting  part of the workout -- from start to finish. \n\nMost of my research indicates mixed results for basically any non-drug treatment.  I understand this, but that is beyond my control right now. \n\nEven if you don't have a single answer to offer, thanks to everyone who read this whole ramble and I hope you are doing well!",https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/udcxha/what_helps_while_waiting_for_first_appointment/

ubifdm,1650884310,Sulfasalazine and pregnancy,"Hi all,\n\nLooking for advice from any previously pregnant RA peeps.\n\nI have recently found out I’m pregnant. I informed my rheum of intention to conceive and hence was put on sulfasalazine and high dose folic acid at diagnosis.\n\nI understand sulfasalazine is generally considered safe for pregnancy. I’ve reviewed a fair bit of the clinical evidence and there seems to be absolutely nothing indicating any significant risk to continue taking it throughout.\n\nHowever my rheum advised that if he was me, he’d likely stop taking it after a positive test. I queried this given he’s said there’s very good evidence that it is safe, and he said it was because most womens RA spontaneously improves during pregnancy, so I likely wouldn’t ‘need’ it, and ‘it’s good to be on as little as possible during pregnancy’. He said if I was one of the women who did need it (ie symptoms returned on cessation), I could just pick it back up and start taking it again. He framed this as a choice for me to make, but the impression I got was that he’d suggest stopping the meds.\n\nThe more I’ve thought about this advice the more confused I am. It’s difficult to get an appointment with him so it’s not so easy to go back and just ask more questions. My next scheduled visit is not until August. \n\nI therefore wondered if anyone would be able to share their experiences please, either with stopping this med or continuing with it throughout pregnancy? \n\nI obviously do not want to cause any risk to my baby but I do have concerns with stopping my treatment. Mainly…\n\n1) I am really well controlled on my meds. I don’t want to risk messing that up. Particularly given uncontrolled RA is a risk to the pregnancy in itself. Also I think a resumption of symptoms would be bad for my mental health.\n\n2) In my mind, my body is currently used to being on the meds, so if I stop, and then find I have to start up again, I’m thinking would this not be more disruptive to my body/ the baby than just carrying on with what it’s used to already?\n\n3) while I may not ‘need’ the meds in pregnancy, I hear most women suffer from bad flares post partum. I do not want that (if at all avoidable!) when taking care of a newborn. I feel it will be both mentally and physically distressing and impede my taking care of the baby. I also want to breastfeed. My thinking is that staying on the meds, I’d have a better chance to avoid this post partum flare. Another option would be to restart taking the tabs straight away after giving birth. However I don’t see how that would confer any additional benefit as they would pass to the baby via breastfeeding then, and in that instance the baby would not be ‘used’ to the meds in the same way as if I’d kept taking them throughout…\n\nVery confused…I appreciate no one here can give medical advice, however any experiences any of you are able to share would be so helpful!

u9t1t0,1650674095,Rheumatoid Roller Coaster,"I first posted in this sub about eight months ago right after I received my (atypical) RA diagnosis. Since then, I've been prescribed celebrex, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, and leflunomide. I had bad side effects from the celebrex, hydroxychloroquine, and leflunomide, and the methotrexate did nothing for me.\n\nSo far, the only thing that seems to have worked is prednisone, and I've been on a maintenance dose of 5 mg for quite a few months. When RA my doc tried to taper the prednisone down to 2.5 mg a few months ago, I found out that I was physically addicted to it, and had a pretty horrible withdrawal episode. I'm also prescribed gabapentin and methocarbamol to manage nerve pain from a bugling disk at C4-5, and found out that I'm physically addicted to gabaentin when I decided to quit that one on my own a few months ago; that led to another nasty withdrawal episode.\n\nWhen I met with my RA doc a week ago, he said it was time to try Enbrel, I had reservations about it because of the potential side effects, which include PML, I've been told. I was not excited by that prospect, but decided to try the Enbrel anyway, which, I was told, would require another drug, isoniazid, to manage the latent tuberculosis that I had picked up somewhere in my life. Fine, I said, let's do this thing.\n\nA couple days into the isoniazid, my feet, ankles, and hands started swelling and hurting. At this point, I understood that this was a reaction to the next drug, so I called my RA doc and he told me to discontinue the isoniazid. I did that, and then about 36 hours later, found myself in another withdrawal episode.\n\nI don't know if you've ever been through withdrawals before, but my take on them is that I'd rather kill myself than go through one of them again. I'm not exaggerating or being melodramatic. In addition to feeling like I'm losing my mind, I have tremors, alternating moments of feeling like I'm freezing and then burning up, and very unpleasant GI issues that I won't get into here. If you've ever seen the film Trainspotting, it's just like the scene where Ewan McGregor's character goes through withdrawals from heroin. Again, I'd rather kill myself than go through a withdrawal epidode again.\n\nSo after my withdrawals from isoniazid resolved, I made the decision that I'm pretty much done with conventional medicine where my RA is concerned. I'm thinking I need a whole new approach to the problem, and I'm thinking that I need to start with changing my diet, and introducing some natural anti-inflammatories like turmeric and ginger into my routine.\n\nSorry for the length of this rant, but I needed to get it out in a somewhat coherent fashion. I guess if I'm looking for feedback, it would be on two fronts: 1) Has anyone else had experiences like I've had with conventional medicine, and, 2) Has anyone tried non-conventional approaches to the problem of RA?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/u9t1t0/rheumatoid_roller_coaster/

Of course my mind races to cancer, but when he called the provider for an update - first the intern said the number wasn't really a concern and they can talk to provider about it on the scheduled call to see if he wants to monitor, but he also said with his family history of RA, it could be from that.\n\nBoth his father and brother have RA, both diagnosed in their 40s.

My PCP is amazing but I always get nervous with specialists because I've had a lot of experiences having my concerns dismissed before.\n\nThe rheum was not at all worried about the ANA because it was so low and didn't see any visible signs of inflammation during her physical but agreed to run more testing (I get free labs with my health insurance so I'm pretty sure she ordered every possible autoimmune screening test there is lol) and do X-rays based on my symptoms. Every single test was normal except for a mildly abnormal serum protein electrophoresis consistent with inflammation.\n\nI was sooooo nervous to see her for my follow up yesterday because I fully expected her to say ""well all your tests look normal so there's nothing wrong with you"" but instead she told me that my symptoms were hard to ignore even if the tests didn't show anything and offered to do a trial of hyroxychloroquine and prednisone to see how I respond. She mentioned that it can sometimes take a while for autoimmune diseases to show up in lab/imaging and that it's better to treat early and be wrong than to ignore it until there's more evidence. \n\nI have to say, it feels so good to have a doctor trust me and take my symptoms seriously rather than treating me like an unreliable witness. I have seen a lot of horror stories online and experienced them myself in the past and this is a breath of fresh air.

They get swollen, hot and painful. Has anyone had a reaction to prednisone like this? Could it be stress? My rheumatologist and my reproductive immunologist both say this shouldn't be happening, but it has happened on all three attempts that we have tried.

u5h6jx,1650177214,What is the best to hope for wrt treatment and maintenance of RA symptoms?,"Hey all. I hung out with my friend today. I helped them rearrange furniture as obviously that’s something that is off the table right now. Once again I’ve noticed that they have been teetering on this internal ledge for months where they don’t want to set off a flare but don’t want to accept that life is different now. They do things like go shopping at a Walmart and never take the electric cart and then suffer for a week. I understand the heartache but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t upset me to witness unnecessary excess pain in someone I love dearly. \n\nI know they want life to be “normal” again. My friend started manifesting symptoms at ~23/24 years old iirc. It’s been so hard. I see people here talk about trying to slow or halt the progress of RA rather than simply manage symptoms. And I also see people talk about the inevitability of a horrific flare. So I am wondering, what is the ultimate goal of treatment? What is a realistic outcome to expect and a realistic timeline to expect it within? \n\nObviously every journey through a chronic condition is unique. I’m not asking for crystal ball predictions and it would be unreasonable to expect them. But as a broad scope, I don’t know what to expect for my friend and what sort of hope to encourage them towards that is both optimistic and grounded in reality. My own chronic diagnoses have taught me that both are important (of course, in tandem with the necessary waves of grief and pride and anger and and and). I won’t rush or lecture them through any of this process. But gentle, empathetic encouragement can go a long way. I really wish they would stop hurting theirself looking for a version of normal that can’t happen anymore. So please, if you’re able and willing, could someone tell me what version of normal is the one to fight for? \n\nI appreciate your continued patience with me. I really want to be supportive and your input thus far has been so valuable. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/u5h6jx/what_is_the_best_to_hope_for_wrt_treatment_and/
u5b0cd,1650154803,Cured?,"TLDR: diagnosed with RA in 2008, great relief with humira, had to stop after cancer diagnosis, moved to a new city and doctors here say I don’t have RA. \n\n\nI was diagnosed with RA in 2018. Started on MTX and prednisone but didn’t tolerate the MTX so was put on humira. It was GREAT! For the first time I could get out of bed every day, not fall asleep at my desk at work, everything hurt a lot less - like I said, it was GREAT. The only problem I had was that after about 10 days I would start to experience strange withdrawal symptoms so we bumped it up to every week instead of every 2 weeks. \n\nFast forward to June of last year - I was diagnosed with breast cancer (I am now cancer free) so the humira was stopped by my rheum. He said after I was finished with all the cancer treatments that he would start me on rituxan - BUT I knew I was moving to Chicago and this would be my last visit with him and that I would be establishing myself with someone new. \n\nAfter my mastectomy, I was referred to a rheumatologist which was the most confusing and dehumanizing experience of my life. He started by saying “I’m sure I won’t be able to find the records from ALL the places you’ve been seen. Basically accusing me of doctor shopping despite ALL of my medical records being at Mt. Sinai. I’ll leave out the details but this is important - at the time I was taking suboxone for chronic pain that was prescribed by my PCP in NYC. In IL you have to be in a MAT program to be prescribed methadone or suboxone. So this guy asks me a bunch of weird questions, orders labs and X-rays and tells me that he thinks I might have ankylosing spondylitis but that I definitely do not have RA. So wait for the tests to come back and we’ll go from there. 2 weeks later he called and said everything was normal and that I have nothing rheumatologically wrong with me and that he would not be treating me. I asked why the humira worked so well then and he responded that he did not know. \n\nAfter that I went to a new rheumy at a totally different hospital fully equipped with printed copies of my records from my rheumy in NYC so she would see those instead of what Dr. Asshole said. She also ordered labs and X-rays and agreed that I do have RA and that as soon as I was finished with my breast reconstruction surgery we could restart biologics. \n\nI’ll be damned if I didn’t get a phone call from my new rheumy’s office 2 days before my appointment telling me she just went into labor and they’ll set me up with someone else. This guy told me I can’t go back on biologics at all because they all increase cancer risk. I asked about the rituxan and he said that it was a very strong medication and that he didn’t think that I had RA either but that if I did it was very “mild” but agreed to start plaquenil. I find that statement odd because when I was first diagnosed that rheumysaid “I’m not surprised you’ve  been in so much pain because your anti-CCP was 4x the cut off. It’s the highest I’ve seen.” \n\nWhat is going on? It’s like my RA has disappeared but I still have all the symptoms. I just want some quality of life back. This is definitely hurting my mental health as well. Is it possible I’m in remission? If I have “nothing rheumatologically wrong with me” why did the humira work so well?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/u5b0cd/cured/

u3rus5,1649971609,5 Years Getting Worse and No Diagnosis,"Hello all,\n\nA few years ago I got a really bad case of food poisoning and it triggered something. I started getting what I believe is some kind of autoimmune related joint pain. The pain seemed especially localized in the areas where my tendons attach to bone and in tendons in my hand.\n\nOver time it seems like the inflammation has subsided from it's highest points, most likely owing to an strict anti-inflammatory diet I've adopted. But I am feeling like I am still slowly getting stiffer over time. Recently I was very alarmed to find that I am unable to stand with experiencing a searing pain in my achilles heel and the tendons in the back of my knee. Usually that pains comes and goes with my inflammation but now it seems like it's almost permanent, which has got me terrified.\n\nThe problem is, I've seen so many doctors and they just keep dismissing me. I've been through almost 5+ primary care physicians, 2 rheumatologists, and more. They run the blood tests and one even did an x-ray, but there's nothing showing up on my charts and my swelling is minimal (but the pain is unending and getting worse over time). I have various other side effects as well (chronic stiffness in my lower back, urinary problems, and for a while I had really bad pain in my eyes). I've been trying really hard to push for an MRI because I think it might reveal some early stage damage or inflammation but I pretty much get scoffed at by every doctor. And because of COVID, every time I try to find a second opinion, it's a one month wait minimum (up to 3-6 months for specialists, in my opinion).\n\nWhat recourse do I have. What should I do? I don't want to be crippled. I can pay for things but I just want someone to take me seriously. I don't want to deal with this for 5 more years and then find out I should have been more proactive.

u0k1ih,1649604826,I've been having persistent muscle tension and body aches that is spreading and getting worse.,"Age: 21. Sex: Male. Height: 5""8. Weight: 120 pounds. Duration of complaint: Almost 2 years. Location: United States. Medication: None.\n\nI've been having persistent body aches and muscle tension for almost 2 years. At first it started in my neck, but then it has spread to my upper back, my arms, my legs, and my butt. Recently it's been getting worse. My legs are weak and they are very tight. I can hardly bend over. This has been getting worse and worse. In addition to this I've lost sensation to my penis. My penis is not as sensitive as it once was; it feels numb and dead. In addition to losing sensitivity to my penis, I can't get an erection. I've been having persistent erectile dysfunction. I can't get a morning erection or random erections.\n\nI've been having constant head pressure. I wouldn't really describe it as a headache, but it's constant pressure and weird sensations in my head. Something feels off in my head. I've been having this symptom in addition to the other symptoms so I feel like this has something to do with it.\n\nI've also lost my ability to be sexually aroused and turned on. I can't get horny like I once did. I don't have the urge to have sex or masturbate. I no longer get sexual desire, dreams, thoughts, or attractions. My reward system in general is not like it once was.\n\nI've been dealing with this for almost 2 years now. I thought this would go away over time, but it hasn't.\n\nFor the past 9 months I've been going to my Doctor to get different tests and treatments done. I've done my routine blood work, a urinalysis, I had an X-ray on my neck, I had Physical Therapy, I had two MRI's: one on my neck and brain, and I had an Echocardiogram. I also spoke to a Urologist to address my sexual dysfunction.\n\nAll tests pretty much came back normal except my blood work showed a mildly elevated PSA (Prostate-Specific-Antigen), my neck MRI showed that I have straightening of my Cervical Lordosis and Mild Disc Dehydration at C5-C6, and my Echo showed that my Right Ventricle's wall thickness was severely increased and the cavity size was reduced.\n\nThe Urologist told me that a 21 year old doesn't need a PSA screening and a mildly elevated result can come from a recent ejaculation. The Urologist also felt like nothing physical was contributing to my ED. My Doctor told me my MRI results are nothing to be concerned about and he doesn't think it's contributing to my symptoms. My Doctor was concerned about my Echo result and referred me to see a Cardiologist. The Cardiologist felt like the test result was inaccurate and had me do the Echo over. I am still waiting for that result.\n\nI will be seeing a Neurologist next month. I will also be seeing another Urologist next month. I plan to get more tests done that can hopefully pinpoint the source of my symptoms. People have accused me of being a hypochondriac and that this is all in my head. I know my body and I know when something is not right. I just want my symptoms to improve and go away.\n\nI speculate I could be dealing with an Autoimmune disorder, a Neurological Disorder, Cardiovascular, etc. I'm not sure.\n\nWhat do you guys think the issue could be?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/u0k1ih/ive_been_having_persistent_muscle_tension_and/

txuo9m,1649274913,3 months in and I am still trying to figure out what I have,"Prepare yourselves it's a long story, but I'll try to make it short.\n\nBackground: 24 years old, programmer (which means I sit long hours), relatively athletic (until 3 months ago lol)\n\nIt started on January 15th. I woke up feeling a little sore on the left side of my lower back near my bum. Didn't think much of it and I though after a good warmup and some stretches would go away. I worked out without weights (have stopped using weights because of wrist injuries) but i didn't feel any better. \n\nNext morning I could barely get out of my bed. Feeling my whole lower back and butt locked and sore. Since it was Saturday i waited till Monday and i went to an orthopedic. He said it's probably from my sitting position, which it could be true but I am very careful how I sit. I usually take breaks to stretch and walk around the house. Anyway he prescribed me muscle relaxants and anti-inflammatory for 10 days.\n\nI started taking them the same day but I started feeling pain on the left temporomandibular joint. When I was trying to open my jaw it would hurt a lot, but after a while it would get warmer and stop aching so much. 6 day went by, my lower back and butt was doing better. I could get out of bed without groaning and using my arms for support. On the 7th day I noticed an edema on my left ankle (inside part of ankle). My ankle movements became limited.\n\nAt the 10th day the doctor suggested to continue the anti-inflammatory for another 10 days which I did. I could go for long walks and do most thing my grandma can do but still felt some irritations. After these 10 days the symptoms slowly came back. \n\nΙ visited a general practitioner. After hearing the story so far said that those things don't add up and the only way they are related it's because of stress. That didn't sound right to me because I am not a stressful guy at all. He wrote me some blood tests which I did.\n\nAlthough I decided to visit a second orthopedic doctor. The blood tests were clear but listening to my story he said it might be rheumatoid arthritis and to visit a rheumatologist right away. He prescribed me a small amount of cortisone till I go to the rheumatologist.\n\nThe next day I took a panoramic X-ray and visited my dentist. He said that my teeth wasn't the cause of the problem so it had to be something else. But he told me that couple of his patients had the same symptoms because of Covid that lasted around 2 months and then went away. Keep in mind that I haven't got Covid, or even if I have i didn't realize it, and I am vaccinated with three shots (Pfizer).\n\nThe day I visited my dentist I noticed a ganglion cyst on my left wrist. My left wrist was bothering me on and off the past year.\n\nCouple days go by and I visit a rheumatologist. After hearing my story he prescribed some x-rays for my back and hips. When he saw them he said that my L5 disc was compressed a little bit. Also I symptoms of osteosclerosis. The rheumatologist prescribed me another type of anti-inflammatory for 10 days. He claimed to be arthritis. When I asked if it was rheumatoid he said ""Arthritis"". I know there are hundreds types of arthritis and it might be difficult to diagnose it.\n\n(Flashback 1 year: That might have happened one year ago when I feel on my knees from a pull-up bar. The military doctor (was in military back then) said that I didn't have anything worrying.)\n\nAfter 10 days I doing better. The rheumatologist advised me to keep taking the pills for 5 days more. Long story short since I was getting better I took them for 30 days (1 pill per day). My condition got better at 50%. But now (one week after I stopped medication) my left ankle got swollen again and my lower back started hurting. Fortunately my jaw doesn't seem to follow this path and still goes strong (let's hope I won't jinx it).\n\nI will re-visit the rheumatologist in 5 days to redo blood tests. I also will visit a third rheumatologist in my hometown during the Eastern holidays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave anyone experienced anything similar? What did you do? \n\nThank you for reading till the end!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. I also visited a chiropractor before the second orthopedic. After some massage and electrotherapy he performed some adjustments on my hips. He said that my right hip was a bit off or something. But that didn't change anything. Although it felt good this chiropractic treatment. They have some pretty relaxing machines.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/txuo9m/3_months_in_and_i_am_still_trying_to_figure_out/

So from 10am-1pm I was in the sun. I put on sunscreen most places, but missed a few (aka tops of my feet) until about halfway through the day. I am so burned and its a painful burn too. Everywhere feels a bit crispy but its really just my feet, back of one hand and my neck that are dark red. I never burn like this, normally get a little pink at most unless I'm baking in the sun on the beach for hours and normally just tan. I know plaquenil has the sun sensitivity warning, but since I didn't have any issues last year I thought I was good. Can the sun sensitivity start later on?

Whatever I don’t even care, I’m on enbrel and it helps so who cares. \n\n\nAnyway the enbrel helps but my right hip is still pretty messed up. Arthritis, bone spurs, a tear in the meniscus. Lots of pain. So my rheumatologist referred me to an orthopedic surgeon. They did an MRI of my hip first and then the next week I went in to see the ortho doc. \n\nThe PA mentions maybe an injection into the joint would help. Or maybe surgery.. she asks which I would prefer. Then the doctor comes in and does the same thing. He says would I prefer an injection or surgery? I am flabbergasted. He hasn’t gone over my MRI results with me, he hasn’t described the surgery. He’s using acronyms that I don’t know and expecting me to understand. How the fck should I know if I need an injection or surgery??? I’m not the damn doctor! \n\nSo I ask him to pull up my MRI and go over it with me. He says he has not seen my MRI and doesn’t have it. All he can see is the one sentence the radiologist wrote. I tell him I have a copy of my MRI in my car on a CD. He tells me to go get it. He looks at it and continues to waffle on the injection vs surgery and asks my opinion again. I want to climb out the window and run away.\n\nI hate going to the damn doctor. \n\n\n\nAnyway that’s my rant thanks for reading I feel stupid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/ts9i46/i_feel_like_i_am_constantly_let_down_by_doctors/

There's period of time where I feel terrible and others where I'm mostly ok.\n\nI've seen a doctor in gastroenterology. Had a colonoscopy which was normal. Diagnosed with IBS.\n\nI've seen a doctor in internal medicine. Had a biopsy done on suspected urticarial vasculitis but it was inconclusive. I did have episodes of urticaria that left bruises for weeks afterwards. Was put on hydroxychloroquine but symptoms persisted so I stopped. No diagnosis. He referred me to an allergy specialist.\n\nI've seen a doctor in allergy. Did not do tests. Diagnostic was autoimmune urticaria. I can't take antihistamines (I have a sensitivity and they worsen my urticaria instead of helping). Was offered to try Xolair but declined.\n\nI've seen a family doctor 2 weeks ago for routine blood tests. My iron is low (always has been) and my MCV is high (always has been but it keeps getting higher). He's making me have more blood work done to find out why.\n\nSo basically, I'm worried that something's wrong and that I'm undiagnosed.

Osteo doc had some concern and ordered RA panel for me. All came -ve execept CCP at 63. Referred to a Rheumatologist (this was late Feb), whose appointment in in May. So I went to another Rheum who was available. She did all inflammatory disease panel and only CCP came back +ve at 60. Also RA IgM is  showed detectable for the first time at 5 (thresh is 6).

Tried driving again in March but the back pain now came back really strong.

They are mainly:\n - hot flashes (daily)\n - A constant feeling of warmth and sweating, which are manifested at rest as well as when performing small household activities such as washing, ironing clothes\n - Daily headaches from the morning after getting up\n - Sweating with short and easy walks\n - Problem with bowel movements (constipation)\n - Very quick fatigue and pain in muscles and joints\n\n I would like to add that for these 5 years I have been looking for the cause of my problems, spending a lot of money on doctors (endocrinologist, cardiologist, neurologist, psychiatrist) and tests.  Unfortunately, no cause could be found.  About 3 years after the onset of hot flashes, I started to have drug conditions because I lost my enthusiasm to go outside very much because my ailments do not let me live.\n I was treated with psychiatric drugs, ssri, and psychotherapy, which made me completely forget about the drug conditions, but did not cure my major health problems.  My psychiatrist argued that if the hot flashes continue, the headaches continue and the drug conditions are gone, the cause may be elsewhere.  So I decided to turn here because maybe someone has struggled with similar problems and will be able to show me the direction in which I could look for the cause ..\n\n I wake up every day with headaches, I will clean my clothes and after going out to the store I am sweaty and tired and all I want to do is go home.  I feel internally that I am a self-confident person and these are not psychological problems.  Before the first hot flashes 5 years ago, I had never been sick or had any health problems.\n\n My diagnostics was in the direction of:\n - the thyroid gland\n - Adrenal glands\n - Head resonance\n - Prolactins\n - Parasites and Lyme disease\n - Intestinal X-rays\n\n I will be grateful for any hints in which direction I can seek help, because the above do not let me live and strongly affect my emotional stability and my life satisfaction which at this state is at 0 level..",https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/tooq0d/hot_flashes_young_man_everyday/

He managed to determine my knee was not the only problem area and that I have changes in the knuckles of both hands and in the toes on my right foot. Since my GP was on top of ordering tests (I already had bloods and an ultrasound and an MRI) and doing a trial run with prednisone, the rheumatologist was able to diagnose me as having early stage, seronegative inflammatory arthritis. He said however that he can't yet tell if it is rheumatoid or psoriatic. I'm not too concerned as treatment is the same either way. He did however decide to trial further diet modifications (had already started on my own) for 3 months rather than put me straight on meds. He did say if I'm not 100% by that time then he probably wants to try Methotrexate. \n\nI have to say I'm pretty impressed. My track record with specialists hasn't been great (I had an immunologist tell me I had no allergies even though they had the CT that clearly showed changes in my nose caused by chronic allergies) so to have one that really seemed to be listening to me was nice. That and I have to give kudos to my GP who was on the ball and brought this diagnosis up as a possibility, it's not something that had crossed my mind. \n\nAnyway, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that I will have this for the rest of my life (currently 24) but just wanted to share with someone that I've actually had a good experience with the healthcare system outside my GP (who I've known is awesome for a while now).",https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/tomaw3/i_kind_of_have_a_diagnosis_now/

Around the same time of year I always flare up and end up having to go on prednisone.They always think it’s my fault and that if I were to just take my medication as directed I wouldn’t be in pain. I’ve been prescribed numerous drugs and such over the years. At one point in time I was getting infusions which were tremendously helping my arthritis. I later started developing mild psoriasis because of the infusions so that stopped. I then started Humira and have been taking it for about 6-7 years give or take. Throughout the 6 or 7 years i’ve been incapable of consistently taking the Humira and whenever I do, i’m still in pain and i’ve talked to my rheumatologist  if there were any other options and she has said that Humira is pretty much my last option. I constantly feel stiffness, and soreness throughout my whole body, as well as extreme fatigue. I could sleep for over 12 hours and I still feel tired and drained. I’ve slept for 8. nope. 5? nope. i’ve changed my diet multiple times and I still find myself getting triggered throughout the day and i’m unsure why. I constantly feel drained as if i’m unable to do anything, especially when i’m having a flare up and my jaw starts closing. I feel stiffness around my neck,hands,knees, and ankles. I feel like a zombie who’s unable to function. Kids at school don’t understand what i’m feeling and instead call me a grandma, teachers don’t sympathize when it comes to work and my guardians just blame me. It feels very lonely because no one seems to understand at all what I feel. It’s so hard to get up from my bed, no matter what time of day it is.

tmayiw,1648129392,Rent - medical gaslighting after six years - don’t know how to carry on.,"I recently saw my regular rheumatologist for an emergency appt after a 4 week flare that rendered me immobile/in wheelchair. Recently I had been diagnosed by another rheumatologist (privately as needed pain relief and she also found a lot of bursitis) with hypermobile EDS on top of existing fibro and RA. \n\nWhen my regular rheumy magicked up an appt (v grateful), he does a vague hyper mobility assessment and puts me on low dose steroids for a few months with no pain relief. Fine. Both rheumatologists think current flare is different things (Eds vs arthritis). No worries. \n\nToday I get his letter to my GP cc’d to me, saying all my diagnoses are up in the air and that I have no inflammatory markers or effusion to define inflammatory arthritis. \n\n\nI get that he’s rather antiquated in his view of RA (dude is nearing retirement) but at referral I had positive anti CCP, ANA, high CRP, high ESR, which naturally stabilised after very early aggressive intervention (my GP’s special interest was rheumatology so he saw the signs early and referred me). I also have had in recent (and old) ultrasounds fluid, inflammation and synovial thickening. The kicker is, in this recent appointment, he showed me my hip x ray that showed thinning of the cartilage in the most affected hip.\n\nAlso he was not involved in my other diagnoses so I’m not sure why he’s bringing them into consideration. He did not perform a full hEDS test. He merely checked a couple of joints. \n\nI’m at my wits end and thinking the pain is all in my head. I KNOW deep down that isn’t right but seeing it in a letter I feel I’m not being taken seriously. I feel absolutely trapped and like a real fool.\n\nI’ve written to him asking for clarification because X, Y and Z as above but the mental toll this blow has taken is frustrating. I already have very poor mental health, mostly as the result of trauma (more gaslighting so this has brought up shit) and the level of pain I am in. \n\nThis is NHS so moving clinic isn’t easy and appointments are few and far between. I only go private for the occasional emergency and can’t rely on that as medication is too expensive and the nhs rheumatologists simply ignore private letters and guidance when sent. \n\nAs dark as this sounds, I wish I’d ended it all at the beginning of my treatment if this is the fight I have to fight.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/tmayiw/rent_medical_gaslighting_after_six_years_dont/
tm46dj,1648122748,First post. Feeling desperate.,"This is my first post ever of any kind about my RA. I've never joined any forums or actually sought support about this before. I guess I just didn't take it too seriously as of the last few months.\n\nI'm 39/male. Diagnosed with RA about 3 years ago after recurring shoulder and wrist tendonitis. RF was over 100, and I was put on MTX and celebrex. My first summer after diagnosis was spent mostly limping as it moved into both balls of my feet.\n\nI've been a few months now without MTX as my Rheumatologist was off and just bad timing, but it's flared to a point where I couldn't even imagine it could. And it finally hit me how intense this disease really is. \nI'm off work now for an indeterminate amount of time. I had to ask my ex to take my kids a few extra days because I can't even drive them to school in the morning. I'm sleeping 3 hour nights and I finally seem to be semi functional in the evening.\n\nI have over 30 joints affected, and it seems like they are always affected. Some days more than others. It's moved into my muscles, ligaments and tendons, specifically my shoulders. It has even affected my ulnar nerve. I have what feels like 2 rotator cuff tears (likely tendonitis) and every morning is spent crying in bed because I can't roll or get up without agony. Then when I finally do get up, my feet throb with every step and it's a battle to put clothes on, or do anything because my hands won't work. I can't hold anything for long because of the shoulder pain, and my neck is getting so stiff from just not being to move alot.\n\nI'm usually very active, in decent shape and I'm used to not stopping during a day. Now some days I can't even put shoes on because anything even brushing against my foot is intense pain. I have a large house to maintain, but if this keeps up I'm going to have to sell. I'm not even 40!\n\nI'm usually very positive, and up until now, no one around me even knew how serious RA was. Because they just saw me living normally, and I don't complain about pain. I have a very high tolerance to pain, but this has honestly brought a grown man to tears and I'm starting to feel the depression kick in. Some mornings I almost wish this would kill me because the pain is just unbearable.\n\n I need to be on MTX for at least 4 months before any further treatment is considered, but I'm really hoping this round will help, as I was increased to 25mg weekly.i think that might max dose for RA?  I'm on 2 daily doses of celebrex, have a medical marijuana growing license, but nothing just seems to help anymore. I get a little relief from draining my hot water tank in the shower, and spending some time in the hot tub, heat pads, but it's always short lived. Next step is physio, and possibly therapy if I keep feeling like this, because my view of the future has drastically changed and this point. \n\nThanks for listening....",https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/tm46dj/first_post_feeling_desperate/

He did a physical exam of me and diagnosed me with RA in his office. I told him that I had NO PAIN in the red toes but He sent me off to do tests and then officially diagnosed me. He told me my toes showed synovial thickening and I had negative RF and slightly positive anti cpp.  Put me on plaquenil.\n\n3 months later he has me in his office and tells me that he now wants me to go on Methotrexate and get sustained remission in RA. No further tests, doesn’t care that Im not in pain and never have been in pain. Tells me that MTX will get me in sustained remission. \n\nI end up starting the MTX for just two courses and decide to get a second opinion. I see a second doctor who does a physical exam looks at my feet and says this is just normal variation with discolouration and everyone’s feet are different. He tells me I have no sign of any past inflammation and wants me to stop MTX. He does another round of tests and all my markers are negative. The ultrasound shows zero evidence of inflammation. I’m not off al drugs and he also told me that it’s not the first time he’s had this happen with this specific rheum who misdiagnosed me. Everyone who he’s taken off has always been fine. \n\nThe point of this is to say get a second opinion if you’re not sure of your diagnosis or prescribed treatemnt. It’s always a good idea to get more than one opinion on your situation. And if you’re not happy with your rheum, get another one. Every doctor has their own biases.

They told me they don’t have one. \n\nI then went to enroll in their co-pay card assistance program. But when I mentioned to the representative that my insurance (Express Scripts) does not put the co-pay assistance towards my deductible or out of pocket, she said I was ineligible for their co-pay assistance program but I might be eligible for their Amgen Edge program for people in this situation with their insurance. \n\nI was transferred to an Amgen Edge specialist who then verified my household income and told me that my income was too high for this program. I asked what am I supposed to do then? They told me I am ineligible for any Enbrel programs and I would need to pay my entire deductible/out of pocket myself.\n\nMy deductible is around 1500 and out of pocket is something like 3800. Do I really need to shell that all out if I want Enbrel or do I have any other options?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/tjhjja/problems_paying_for_enbrel/

tjaw4r,1647866381,Humira and Remicade didn't work. Starting from scratch with a new rheumatologist,"1. My first rheumatologist took me off of MTX after a couple of months, after a blood test showed kidney function problems. \[I thought it was premature, because I had also been taking NSAIDS that I found out later are bad for the kidneys\]. It seemed to help.\n2. Next, he put me on 40mg Humira injections every 2 weeks. After no improvement, he had me injecting 40mg once a week. Still no improvement after more than a year.\n3. Then, after a break \[using prednisone to control the flares\], I started Remicade infusions. After the loading doses were on board, 8 weeks later, no improvement. Still needed prednisone to control the severe flares. 16 weeks later, I stopped the infusions, and switched rheumatoligists.   \n\n\nAnybody else have a similar history or experience? Did you find a solution?  \nThank you",https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/tjaw4r/humira_and_remicade_didnt_work_starting_from/

tj4x46,1647842727,Year round allergy symptoms caused by RA?,"Ever since I was diagnosed with RA, I have struggled with constant, year round, allergy symptoms. Mainly nasal congestion where I can’t breathe out of a nostril but nothing comes out when I blow my nose. \n\nI’ve tried a lot of different things: allergy meds, Flonase, neti pots, and sinus rinses. The sinus rinses are helpful. The others are meh. I stay away from things like Afrin because I know those are harmful. \n\nI get these symptoms even in the winter, when it’s -20 here in Minnesota and everything is frozen. There’s no clear pattern that would help me pinpoint the culprit for these symptoms. \n\nWhich leads me to wonder if it has something to do with RA? Something like chronic inflammation in the nasal cavities? \n\nI got a referral to an ENT but haven’t made an appointment. I’m not sure how helpful it would be and don’t want to waste my money. \n\nAnybody else experience this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/tj4x46/year_round_allergy_symptoms_caused_by_ra/
tj1pvh,1647831004,Mini flares - is this a thing?,"Have had RA for nearly 15 years now and generally it has been well controlled. Have been off all meds for nearly a year now without issue. Recently (past 10 days) feeling significant increase in fatigue, have had some soreness in the morning in hands/elbows and extreme night sweats. Curious if this is either the start of a flare or if it could just be a blip that resolves itself.  Has anyone else had similar “mini” flares, and if so, has it resolved on its own or have you had to use meds to control?

tj0lbf,1647827330,Anyone have sunburn trigger a flare?,"Long story short, I got a sunburn this afternoon and now (this evening) I have a rash on my upper chest, nausea, and severe joint pain in my right fingers and wrist. The pain is much more severe (7/10) than the amount of pain I have during a “regular” flare\n(3-5/10). \nI am normally very cautious about my sun exposure and haven’t had a sunburn in probably eight years. I’ve had some sort of autoimmune disease (tested negative twice for RA even though it runs in my family and was diagnosed as inflammatory arthritis) for about the same amount of time. \nThe sunburn isn’t super bad but I am definitely pink all over my body as I was outside in shorts and a tank top and then a bikini for probably two hours and I have extremely fair skin. I know I’m dumb and shouldn’t have stayed out so long but I never thought something like this was even a possibility. \nIs this even a thing or is it just a coincidence?",https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/tj0lbf/anyone_have_sunburn_trigger_a_flare/

tiiy5s,1647775331,Has anyone (without being diagnosed previously for arthritis) had really bad joint stiffness at night?,"More context: I was on high dose prednisone for about 6 months or so after being diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease….\n\nI used to lead a very active life weight lifting 4-5 days a week, but that stopped. It’s been about 4 months off and I notice joint stiffness when doing the slightest things such as sitting down.\n\nThis isn’t normal for me. I’ve also noticed it seems more prevalent at night time or really late like 2 am. I also noticed my bones in my toes feeling stiff.\n\nI’m wondering if prednisone can cause this.

tidbgh,1647751162,really bad wrist pain due to arthritis?,I know this is definitely a question for a doctor but I haven't seen a rheumatologist probably since I was about 16 and I'm 26 now lol. I stopped all medication for arthritis when I was about 17. I was diagnosed with RA at 14 and lived in pain basically since I can remember as a small child. Doctors can see my arthritis damage in x-rays but the one and only time when I was 14 they did bloodwork and said I was sero negative. Truly I have no idea if I have arthritis I just know I've been in pain literally all my life from my shoulders down to my feet. But my main question right now is for the past couple months I cannot move my wrists or rotate them in any direction without sharp severe pain that makes me lose all strength in my wrists and hands. If I'm sitting on the floor I cannot push myself up off the floor. It's severe pain and I go limp I have to roll over onto my stomach and get up from my knees. I can't pick up anything with weight. I can't basically just pick up a paper towel. I have no numbness or tingling. I just completely lose grip and ability to use my hands and wrists. Since I still am on edge if it's actually arthritis or something else just wondering if people with arthritis have gone through something similar to my symptoms? Or maybe this sounds like something else and I should go into debt and spend $700 I don't have on a doctors appointment for them to tell me I'm dumb and it's just arthritis 🤣,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/tidbgh/really_bad_wrist_pain_due_to_arthritis/

thzyax,1647710242,Books or good resources to learn,"Hi all, I've posted a couple of times here or in r/rheumatoidarthritis but wanted to tap in again and see if any of you can recommend a good book or website to learn more about RA. I picked up a book called The First Year: Rheumatoid Arthritis - An Essential Guide for the Newly Diagnosed and Living with Rheumatoid Arthritis. I'm working through the first one, but wondering if there's an updated option as that book I believe is from the early 2000s. Have you found any particular websites/articles/books helpful for you? My primary concern is learning to eat in a way that limits inflammation and pain, as well as the science behind what is happening and how this could impact my body beyond joints. I was just diagnosed in December 2021 and starting on my second med, Enbrel, as methotrexate didn't work and my doctor believes I'm in the moderate-severe category.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/thzyax/books_or_good_resources_to_learn/
