I get good grades, I do my chores, cook my own dinner. I still live with them since I'm just not ready to move out. The thing that hurt me the most was in the past. I was doing maths when I was young with my mother and that time I was dumb. I  would sometimes get the answers wrong and she yelled at me but then she said ""You should have never been in the world, die."" I tried holding in my tears then I started crying even more. Then she said ""I'm going to email your teacher and say how bad you are."" I was so angry I yelled ""W-why are you doing this to me mother? Don't you love me?"" then she snickered and went on her computer to email the teacher. The teacher never received the email because she was too busy making lessons for our class. \n\nNow I am no longer being doing what my parents ask me. I'm 21!

ueindc,1651227076,Should be too busy to be this miserable,"These past few months have been the absolute worst of my life. I keep thinking it'll be better next week and then it never is. I'm literally having to live hour by hour because there's not enough time in the day for me to meet deadlines. I'm more miserable than I have ever been and it's just compounded by the unending mental breaks that I should've been having every few months for the past 3 years. \n\nI legitimately am either in hell or cursed. I used to have everything balance out good thing bad thing, but now all the good things get twisted and are just not in balance with the bad in the first place. The worst of it started out small like just really bad luck and timing like spilling a glass of water 8 times in the same week but now it's graduated to stuff like my laptop falling apart 3 days before a massive presentation. \n\nA presentation I could not look more incompetent at. I'm going to be publicly embarrassed by it more times that I can count this weekend, even more so than I already am. \n\nI'm at a point where nobody can know that I'm so depressed I'm incompetent or it could be bad for me. I have a huge opportunity coming up and now I know I'll be too worn down and tired and burnt up to do well at it. And I haven't hardly even been happy about it because I was fairly certain I was a diversity hire (most definitely know that now but I thought I came to terms with it), other people clearly don't think I deserve it, and now I've been told by someone close to it that I should expect sexism. I just wish I could start over, I feel like everyone is watching me and they are. Usually I could have my little breakdowns privately, but now that it's this bad it happens to coincide with when I finally had gotten some professional respect and good friends. \n\nI've had to pull more than 10 all nighters in the past month and it's still not enough time. I can't do all that's demanded of me. My physical health is completely gone as well. I'm starving at all hours of the day no matter what I do, every joint in my right leg aches like someone took hammers to them, I've had extreme stomach problems bordering on emergency room bad, my heart pangs all the time and I wake with it hurting, and in general my brain is out the window. \n\nIt's bad enough that I haven't been able to do any hobbies or relax (not that I would anyways since the extreme guilt and anxiety about not working even when I have nothing due brings me to stare at walls instead for the past two years), but now even the one thing in life I want to do and feel I'm good at fills me with unimaginable dread. I still want to do it, but what I need is to sleep for 3 weeks straight and then change my identity first. \n\nI had started seeing a counselor, and she seemed startled at how bad it was an offered that I could sign a release form so they could explain to my teachers what my problem is. Obviously I can't do that, but if I don't I might fail classes since I've been so weak and fatigued I've slept through so many. Doesn't help that I accidentally slept through my latest counseling appointment as well where I'd make that decision and now I'm too busy to call and reschedule or even have an appointment. \n\nLike, if I'm honest I think a lot about getting into a freak accident and how nice it'd be to have an excuse to be such a failure. But then I think about how that'd make me run behind on my due dates and I feel even worse. \n\nI cannot win. I know all the reasons I'm miserable, but I can't do a single thing about it. Any sort of advice on how to somehow build back up my physical strength and gain any sort of happiness again once this is all over would be appreciated, because I don't know how I'm gonna claw my way back out of this one with years of work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ueindc/should_be_too_busy_to_be_this_miserable/

But it’s exam season rn so already mental health will be a bit harder and I just had an episode in my library and idk I just needed to talk about it and I didn’t know where else to do it cos I don’t wanna worry my parents right now.\n\nI think I have an obsessive, fixative kind of mind and it’s really taking advantage of my weaker mental defences rn. I got stuck in a spiral thinking abt someone I obsessed heavily over a few months ago and it took me a good few minutes to work myself out of it and it was just so much worse because I’m in public so I just had to lock up and my vision went blurry and I couldn’t breathe but I didn’t want to make a scene. \n\nIt’s over now but.

ueillf,1651226851,My existence amounts to nothing.,"I dunno where to start exactly. I've been living in solitude for two years, and the amount of people I've seen that aren't my family I could count on one hand. I have no job, no car, no schooling, no friends, and no love. I just exist and it FUCKING SUCKS! There's nothing in life that even keeps me motivated and the only reason I haven't offed myself is because it'd hurt my family. None of my medications have worked and I can't feel anything other then an overwhelming amount of loneliness and worthlessness. I can't commit to anything. I've tried to get a job and get my license and I failed drastically my fear of driving crippled me from attempting to learn any more and without a license I couldn't get a job. All of my old highschool friends dropped me after graduation two years ago and I haven't had anyone close to me since. It hurts being constantly alone. Nobody who i used to consider a friend or even an acquaintance has reached out to me. Ive tried to talk and reconnect but im just left on read or blocked by them. There are a few people online that I can talk to but it doesn't compare to in person interactions. I want to laugh with someone, I want to love someone, I want to cry with someone, I want to feel wanted by someone. I want a sense of worth in my life and I just can't seem to get it. I feel like God (if he even exsists) is just playing games with me. Anytime something starts to go right it all goes up in flames and I end up back to square one. I just want to be held by someone and have them tell me it'll be ok. I have so many things that I want that I just can't have. I hate it here. I can't do this anymore I can't keep taking pointless medications that don't even help me. I can't talk to my family about this because all they ever do is pity me and then pretend that I'm normal. Like can they not see that I'm suffering? I'm scared, I'm extremely scared of the future as I can't see anything good happening to me. Am I a bad person for this? Am I a selfish person for wanting to be worth something? I just don't know what to do other than die. There's no point in my life. How can it get better? What do I need to do to be worth something in this life? Solitude is fucking with my brain right now. It's 4 AM and I'm in complete tears as I right this. I pity myself. I hate myself.

ueiks1,1651226755,I'm at a point where i have completely lost self respect,"I know a lot of the posts here have very little answers but that's fine. I don't really talk to anybody about my struggles and things I'm dealing with and most of the time like to skip the conversation so I thought I might try on here discussing (this will probably be very long). Ever since high school I wasn't really bullied face to face but people just like to liked to talk behind each others back behinds and i was a victim. I started to distance my self from friends after school, I never got a job or girlfriend or even kissed a girl in my life. I am turning 21 soon. I wasn't a weird kid growing up but I certainly am not a looker and got made fun of my appearance which is my tiny hands and square head and having more Estrogen than a woman and Small pp. basically anything that is manly, I look like a bitch. I'm not diagnosed but i know I have autism with the way i act, mood swings, and a monotone when i talk and constantly getting annoyed with any inconvenience. When i really started to know how i was different. It really hurt me bad. \n\nBut yeah I've just been home doing the same shit, watching videos, movies, games, eating, sleeping, shitting since 2018 (HS grad). Rather repetitive eh? at some point i just accepted I'm different and don't meet other people's energy and staying home and watching other people is my escape. Whenever I'm out when I'm not with a friend or family and alone i get anxious about just the way I walk. I overthink absolutely everything, It's really annoying and I'm barely ever chill. Don't want to say I have severe anxiety because I still can talk to people like chit chat but its all really mixed and not straightforward. I honestly think that I have a personality disorder like everything i say feels orchestrated. \n\nNo motivation in finding a job or girlfriend AT ALL. Like I will always try to dodge discussions with my dad. A lot of people here have tried and talk about failing but I never even started! Just talking about this gets me really anxious and I hate it. I helped my father with his painting and while I CAN paint AND I feel good after finishing I just want it to end and go back home because I don't like painting. I'm going to be straight up saying this. It's so hard to convince me to find a job at the very least, You can say all the benefits and how it makes you feel better and how it is necessary but I still probably won't do anything about it.

It's not like the work is terrible, there's just so much other stuff I'd rather do. Obviously, most people feel this way, but somehow they're able to just push through it. That's the part I just cannot figure out. All I've gotten was stuff like ""its just part of being an adult"", ""grow up"", ""you just have to push through it"", etc. Other advice was to stay busy after work.\n\nIt's just not really working for me. Everyday I debate suicide. I cry myself to sleep. I don't even chase my dreams anymore. I've tried different kinds of medications, none of them helped. Therapy wasn't really helping either, plus I don't even have the money for it. I just don't know what to do anymore and I'm tired of trying. \n\nI took a mental health break from work for a few months to work on my life outside of work because it was pretty shitty. I cut some bad family members out of my life, was working on my art full time, made a few new friends. Life was good and I looked forward to every day. Ever since I started working again, life feels shitty. I just feel like I'm not cut out for life. I try to do stuff after work and sometimes I can enjoy myself but more times than not I just feel like shit or have no energy.

ueh7ub,1651220498,Second time in a depressive episode. I need to think out loud.,"I know that happiness and goodness aren't things to be deserved, because many people who deserve to be happy and have good things are not given either according to their merits.  But neither are they things to be expected, because happiness nor goodness fall onto the laps of everyone equally.   If these things are unconditionally hard to find, isn't it strange that we haven't formulated a way to access either by now?\n\nI know that people want to point to pornography and fiction as first-principle solutions for that type of happiness and goodness, but I think we all know that such things aren't visceral; you can't feel any fulfillment from masturbation without relationships.  You don't feel any of the satisfaction from vicariously living the power fantasies of a character far more pathetic, and yet simultaneously far morally superior than you.  Both of these are constructs that can be easily taken apart.\n\nAnd yet, we're layering on sheets of artificiality, idealism, and romanticism onto the most real ways we can achieve happiness and goodness.  Most of my friends say to me that they wouldn't date friends; simultaneously, the friends that do have dates are able to do so because of me: I make relationships happen on their behalf through gatherings, set-up dates, etc.  I trim down over-expectations of flowers and chocolates, but I do make a point to appreciate small, meaningful gestures.  I've been trying to keep a realistic foundation for my friends so they don't spiral into depression, get into petty fights, etc.  I encourage friends who find themselves in a nasty, near-constant cycle of hookups to take a step back and embrace themselves before they embrace another body.  Moderation, self-indulgence, validation...you name it, I've done it.\n\nAnd in spite of all of that, I still feel empty inside.  I've tried to derive happiness from myself and achieving goals both in the short and long terms, but it didn't leave me in the least bit satisfied.  Maybe I've internalized a belief that everything I've done doesn't count towards anything, or maybe I always beat myself up for not doing better.  Sometimes it's one, or the other, but at the end of the day I will always feel unsatisfied.\n\nFor a long time I've created self-satisfaction in constructing others' lives; helping them make good decisions, reconsider career paths, end rotten relationships and begin new ones (and in one particular instance, refresh an old one into something else entirely).  I don't think I was ever needed for them to continue on the way they were going, but at the same time I can't imagine some of my friends getting out of the worst parts of their own depressive episodes without me. I can't imagine anyone else being the realist, the common-sense speaker because no other friends of mine have sat down to think about these kinds of things at length.  Coming from a culture with high expectations and a sort of arrogant ignorance to how stunted we emotionally are these days, my friends are used to being overachieving paragons that their families can rely on.  So I know my existence has had net positive value on the world, assuming that my friends are the good people I see them as.\n\nIt's just that...what's the point of it all?  Part of me knows that I'm just flat out unable to get any dopamine / serotonin rewards from helping people anymore (which is why I can't derive pleasure from what I'd usually do), but a much larger part is trying to wrestle with this is just the dejectedness I feel when I look at the grand scheme of things: that I'm using my friends' lives as tools to make me happy.  That, if I were to be alone, I would be no more happier to be dead than to be alive.  Food that I eat doesn't taste as flavorful as it used to.  Pinching my skin fails to elicit as sharp a pain response as I expect.  Hell, even the sounds of rain and waves jammed into my ears at 3 AM at night fails to leave any impression of calm on me.  No, I don't have COVID.  I can still taste sugar and smell fried garlic, among other things.\n\nIt's just that I'm scared that, when I do go into that great unknown, every good (particularly the good) and bad I've ever done will be forgotten and temporary in the memories of the people I love.  It's not so much the fact that life is meaningless, but rather the idea that my life won't be meaningful to someone else.  And then like the life I'm experiencing right now -- a life that seems so empty that it feels almost artificial -- will be remembered as so insignificant that it leaves no impression on anybody.  That's what I'm scared of, and even that fear is slipping away into apathy.\n\nOn one hand, I don't want to become a husk of a person that continues to be a waste on my family and friends.  But I don't want them to feel guilt for me dying, even if none of what I want to do is their fault.  And I owe some of these people a lot of things.  At this point, I can only hope I can hold on long enough to pay them all back before I lose even my sense of loyalty. \n\nIf I'm lucky, this will be something that passes with a bit of time and maybe a pep talk.  I'll be able to eat food again, feel good air come in and out of my lungs, etc.  Realistically speaking...I think I'm going to come right back to this hole again, eventually.  And I'm scared of what the future me will become by then.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ueh7ub/second_time_in_a_depressive_episode_i_need_to/

Don't make fun of me.\n\nthis may be long, probably a jumbled up mess that nobody will read. \n\nI mean I had my issues, (COCSA ""abuse"" when I was really young (3.7-5, or even earlier but thats when my memory of everything starts, around 3.7, that kinda fucked with my mental state)  that let me to being very sexual, I don't remember much about it. and I had two cats, one very old and then the new kitten die, and a somewhat close family member die within a year, and go through a traumatic day where I thought my mother was going to die that night, all that jazz, but I still managed to be happy. \n\nIt was really coming together, I was attractive, popular, (not rich, but was happy with everything I got), and got really good grades (I literally wouldn't be surprised if I had never gotten anything under an A), and I know my life would have been good, (I've always waited to be this age :/, never thought I would have been suicidal for 22-23 months at this point 😭), and a social butterfly. I guess my only con  (obv there's prob others but nothing off the top of my head) was I was never that nice (I mean, I did decent things, like sharing or whatever, like I would never bully anyone or anything and wouldn't be mean to people who treated me properly), I just never tolerated anyone, really, and got into stupid drama occasionally, nothing to serious though, or really physical since nobody really attempted to hurt me, and even when it happened I tried to just defend myself without harming the other person much since I didn't want it to be a big deal or get in trouble, especially a suspension that would suck.  oh yeah besides being ""slutty"" I guess.\n\nAnyways enough talking about that. \n\ncovid started happening, and I never got into contact with any of my friends when the lockdown happened, since they were all ignorant and believed the school when they said it would be 2.5 weeks. although I never believed it tbh. \n\nthen my life was still decent, my mother decided to homeschool me though. and around mid 2020 I got sadder, rolled into very serious suicidal depression pretty quick, I started getting uglier (not taking care of myself, and having a really awful haircut, really tired looking face and under my eyes, from 2-4  hours a day of sleep), and it just became nights of crying and days of utter stress from confusion about school, and everything was all messed up, it's not that interesting or anything, and then just continuing on, getting more and more depressed, and suicidal. I've accepted that I'm going to hell if it exists, so I'm not really afraid to kill myself and have an easy way to do it (Easy access to a pistol and it's gun, while being alone) also some mental illness stuff  probably caused or helped by the circumstances.\n\nnow time is going by super fast, I remember mid 2021 going crazy about it, remember doing it previously and I swear early 2021 feels like 0.5-1.25 months ago, and mid-late 2020 feels like 2-3 months ago.\n\nmy life is awful\n\nI'm not gonna go anywhere, I have no social life. I'm not gonna be a social butterfly, the old me almost feels unreal, like it doesn't exist. i'm such a loser, no self will (something I was really good at), nothing. society is going in a bad direction anyways. I'm never gonna have money, friends, I wonder if I'll ever have a husband. \n\nmy education is pretty bad and doesn't feel stable at all and it's just like a little bit of a workbook that I cheat on half of the time and get terrible grades on, and  I'm completely addicted to electronics. and don't understand a lot of the subjects, with no help whatsoever. \n\nSorry, I know this is probably poorly written.

I'm not religious but it makes me really hope I'm wrong and that people who struggle and suffer that much here do get to live on and finally be free of that in some kind of heaven or afterlife.\n\nAnd it's almost a reminder like ""hey you've been doing better lately but here's everyone talking about someone that struggled just like you do.""

ueczis,1651203439,tinder disaster,"Okay so...I really need to get today out of my mind so here goes. I (29 F) have struggled with depression and anxiety for pretty much as long as I can remember.  And pretty recently I've been feeling much better about myself. I was on antidepressants for a few years, and one of then made me put on quite a bit of weight. So I stopped taking it, and since then I've lost about half of what I've gained. And I've been trying hard to lose the rest. Anyways,  I've been feeling much better recently and so I decided to maybe try and date again since it's been awhile so I reinstalled tinder. So I immediately matched with one guy and he was really awesome. He sent me long messages, we had a ton of common interests, and he seemed genuinely interested in what I was saying.  At one point we had talked about mental health and I had told him about my weight gain experience and that I was still working to lose it. He was very supportive. Well anyways, today he asked me for my weight and height and that his tinder date yesterday was much larger than her pictures  and that he was embarrassed to be seen with her. At this point I should have just dropped him because that's an appalling thing to say. But I told him anyways. He then proceeds to tell me that I'm much too large for him and canceled our planned date. I'm confused why he matched with me at all of thats how it was because my photos were a little older but were still accurate. Well it took a huge blow to my self esteem. And I'm trying to pretend it's fine because who cares what one random jerk thinks if I feel good about myself. But it's been haunting me all day at work and I can't stop reliving the conversation in my head, rethinking what I should have done or said. And I just feel myself slipping back into my depression thinking what's even the point of trying when I still can't be good enough for anyone...I don't know of anyone will even read this but I just really needed to get it off my chest.

ueb8pj,1651197878,someone please help me realize there is a light at the end of the tunnel.,"hi everyone… for some backstory, I’m a 28 year old female with a 5 year old. her dad and I have been split up for a year and a half. our relationship was very toxic; he cheated, we fought, I never forgave him, etc. It wasn’t a good environment to raise our daughter in. \n\nthe last year and a half have been absolute hell. he’s made my life very hard - he criticizes my every move and belittles me as a mom. I’m not going to sit here and say I’m perfect; I still have a lot of unresolved resentment and anger about our relationship. but I’ve tried really hard, especially these last few months, to be civil with him. \n\nhe knows something about me that I told him in confidence years ago when I trusted him. he’s the only one that knows. I’m ashamed of it and hate myself for it; I’ve even considered suicide over it. and he knows that. tonight we got in a huge fight about something related to our daughter that he was in the wrong for, and it turned really nasty. we were both name calling and tearing each other down. I feel terrible about it even though he was in the wrong. \n\nhe threw my secret I told him in my face multiple times and even though I said some not so nice things, I did not and would not do something like that. I know everyone makes mistakes and this mistake had nothing to do with him or my daughter. and the guilt for this mistake eats away at me every. single. day. what’s even worse is I’m always worried he will exploit my secret or use it against me somehow. it scares me to death. \n\nI texted him and apologized for fighting and for saying mean things. I told him I just want us to be civil. I begged him, actually. He of course told me to save it and said he didn’t care if we fought for the next 20 years. \n\nthese past few weeks I finally felt better about my life. I felt happier, I felt more confident that things would be okay. for once I didn’t feel like jumping off a cliff. I know I can’t let one fight make or break me, but now all these thoughts are swirling around in my head again. \n\nI know this seems like a co-parenting sub post, but I’m not looking for advice on how to co parent better. I’m looking for advice on how to see a light at the end of a very dark tunnel. a tunnel that I’m terrified I won’t make it through. I don’t even want to dislike this man anymore, no matter how hard he tries to tear me down. \n\nI want to be a good person, even if that means letting him treat me like shit and not fighting about it. he has been wreaking havoc on my life since 2015 when we got together and there are days  I’m only here because of my daughter. because I think of her face and it makes me hang on. but just knowing that he is okay doing this to me for the foreseeable future makes me feel insanely depressed. I just want to be happy. I want to be a good mom. I want to forgive myself for the terrible mistake I made years ago. I don’t want to be this way anymore.

ueaw3y,1651196825,I feel like I need help,"I am 23 years old and I am planning on getting married in September and moving out by then. I am happy to be getting married, I am happy to be moving out and starting my adult life, but I have never been more miserable in my LIFE. My friends and I have been on a very rocky road since 2020 and basically every social event since has been incredibly awkward. The last time we hung out during thanksgiving was great I thought we broke through and it was okay for a while, but of course there is that awkward transition from arguing to friends again. Unfortunately, during this time my dad went to rehab for alcoholism. Talking to my friends just felt off, I didn’t dislocate this information because I felt like it was too much too fast. Then I got COVID in December and I spent too much time alone and I just got in my head. I cut all contact. The more days passed the more I told myself to respond to texts and to just talk that it wasn’t too late. But it was so hard. My dad left rehab and immediately relapsed. It was hard,and I wanted to just talk about it but I’m at a point in my life where I just avoid confronting my feelings and my emotions just because it’s easier. I’m physically okay, I’m getting ready to get married, I SHOULD feel ok. But I’m miserable. I keep thinking that my friends possibly think I’m intentionally ignoring them or that I’ve just decided not to pursue a friendship with them anymore. It’s not just them, I’ve also cut acquaintances out of my life, that I’m pretty sure would have budded into amazing friendships. I’m at a point where every time I get alone time and it’s just me, I just get sad because I think of everything wrong in my life all at once. The worst part is that I know I’m the only one who can help me, whether it’s through therapy or just reaching out to my friends, but I just can’t bring myself to do it or anything for that matter.

ueau1y,1651196643,how can i help my boyfriend who is too depressed to love me?,"my boyfriend (24m) and i (22f) have been together for about 6 months. the first three months were so great, but after he got rejected from the grad program he applied to, things really went downhill.\n\nHe doesn’t have a history of mental illness, just some mild anxiety and a bit of seasonal depression. Now he is severely depressed, and extremely anxious all the time, and since this is new to him he really doesn’t know how to cope. I’ve dealt with very severe anxiety and mild depression my whole life, but his issues are different (time anxiety + existential anxiety etc) and i struggle to understand what’s going on in his mind and how to help him.\n\nHis depression has killed his sex drive, its been over a month since we last had sex. We rarely go out anymore because he’ll have panic attacks. He doesn’t really do anything for me because he’s too depressed (my love language is acts of service so this is tough), he’s hardly present at all in the relationship. He’s not the same person i started dating; he’s a shell of himself and it’s one of the most devastating things i’ve ever witnessed. He’s an incredibly kind, loving, caring person; beautiful in every sense of the word. Easily one of the most amazing people i’ve ever met in my life. I fell for him almost immediately upon us meeting and i’ve never stopped loving him for a second, but i really really miss the person i met six months ago. my heart physically aches thinking about seeing him laugh and joke and feel at ease. im tearing up just writing this. i love him so much and i just wish i could fix all of this for him. \n\nWe had a serious conversation the other night about breaking up; our relationship is a huge stressor for him because he feels really guilty about being a “bad boyfriend”. i honestly don’t care about that, i just want him to feel better. in this conversation i told him i loved him for the first time, and he couldn’t say it back. He just cried and said “im sorry, im so sorry i dont know whats wrong with me”. He made sure i know how much he cares about me but he cant really feel any real emotions right now and he’s terrified. i know it’s not his fault, and it’s pretty much what i expected to happen, but im still hurt.\n\nHe still goes to work, to the gym, participates in all his hobbies, but just finds everything really bland and nothing alleviates his anxiety. he is going to start therapy soon. right now im really his only support, nobody else knows how hes feeling. He feels badly about this and worries he’s “using” me, but he’s too scared to talk to his parents or friends. i’m working on this because i think its a really important next step for him, but for now its kind of just me and him against the world. I’ve been in a similar position before so the pressure doesn’t really bother me. I’ve been continuing my life and doing fine. \n\nmost of my friends (internet friends who don’t know him) think im absolutely insane for staying with him. they say he doesn’t care about me or try at all to make me happy and that i deserve someone who can love me. i explain it over and over again but they say im just making excuses and justifications and that i need to stand up for myself and move on. i genuinely cannot imagine leaving my partner right now. I’m the only person he has and i love him so dearly. i think it would be cruel to leave him and i want to stay by his side. however, that aside, i dont WANT to leave him. he still makes me happy and i cannot express what an amazing, talented, incredible person he is. it’s a privilege to even know him.\n\nTLDR: my boyfriend is extremely depressed and didn’t say ‘i love you’ back when i said it for the first time. My friends think i should leave him but i love him too much. \n\nhow can i further support him???

ue9idm,1651192505,Depression free for almost a year. Now it's back in full swing.,"I've been dealing with depression for years. I was on a cocktail of lexapro, welbutrin, and trazadone to deal with it. About a year and a half ago, I had gotten to a good place mentally and decided I wanted to wean off the meds. I did so and things were great until work stress and relationship stress sent me into a bit of a depressive episode. My boyfriend and a new therapist helped me work my way out and things have been good for almost a year now.\n\nI moved back in with my parents 4 weeks ago. 4 weeks is all it took to ruin all that. And the worst part? In all my years of therapy, I never had a therapist focus on my childhood. It was always on work stress or relationship issues or bullying in school. This therapist (who I love) had me start digging down deep to see where my problems originate. And I've become very aware of the shitty things my parents did to me growing up. So now, I'm stuck living with them, aware of what happened, aware of what they're actually doing when they treat me like this still. AND MY THERAPIST HAS BEEN ON MATERNITY LEAVE FOR 2 MONTHS. So I can't even talk about it. She just opened me up to be aware of it and now I'm here struggling. \n\nI've lost all my autonomy, all my privacy, all my freedom. I'm not respected. And frankly, it sucks being in someone's house when you know they hate you.

I need to just say it and hope someone is patient with me. i just need someone to hear me and see me and fucking listen and maybe tell me I'm not wrong for being depressed.\n\ni don't have any friends, I live with elderly parents, and recently relocated 700 miles away from my birthplace where my entire life was. I was forced to move with my parents due to our home state being unaffordable. I could not afford to stay behind--I had to leave my home at 25 years old. I know there are worse experiences under the sun but this is likely my most dramatic life change to date.\n\nI'm realizing now as an adult my parents and their religion basically created my mental issues--I was taught to basically fully give myself up, over to god, and that there were always people worse off than I--so how *dare* I be upset about anything about *me*.\n\nso, me staying in this house long-term is not good for my mental health because those same tenets are things my parents wholly believe in. I'm closeted bi/non-binary as well, and can never come out or risk being kicked out. unfortunately, i still depend on them for financial assistance. I do not make enough money, although i finally managed a steady paycheck and a job, I don't have health insurance, so i am currently completely unmedicated and fighting the depression I was diagnosed with at 16. \n\nI graduated university--barely, not without having an episode so bad it almost got me hospitalized against my will. i threatened a student on campus in the middle of an episode and they called campus police, who called an ambulance, all while i was having a mental breakdown. so yeah actually that might be my most traumatic experience. suppressed that until this second--lets go back to suppressing that.\n\nmy dad drove out and got me out of the hospital. so my parents support me fiercely while also being really bad for my mental and emotional health. I wish I could get out of this house. I've felt like moving to somewhere so far from home that we had never even *visited* in the middle of COVID summer 2020 lockdown--it's like being sucked into a dark abyss. I feel like I've lost all sense of myself and I'm slowly losing my grip on what I understood reality to be. I am so devastatingly lonely because I know i have isolated, but also been too afraid to go out. This has happened to my whole family. none of us go out--because we dont know the area, because there's COVID, because we are strangers to the way of life down here.\n\nI have the same 3 hobbies i spin on a wheel and do every day while smoking a fuck ton of weed. I have a degree that feels increasingly more useless. I have student debt, I am obese, and I have parents who get uncomfortable when I cry or tell me that they don't know how to help me, or that ""you were such a happy child."" They don't leave the house either. we are all trapped. moving like this was the worst idea ever in my opinion but we had no choice, financially.\n\nOn top of everything, the world is getting worse. i see a very bleak future for us all and I struggle really badly to look at anything good in the world anymore without a tinge of pain and guilt that it is all going to end and get worse and worse until we die and I am ultimately powerless. It's existential depression on top of regular, personal depression.\n\nAll my relationships have fallen apart or I have not maintained them. i am getting worse at being a human and i don't know where to go anymore rn.

ue4pze,1651178570,I want to get better and I still have hope,as of today I'm about a week relapsed on my pill addiction. I just got to one of the lowest points of my life again and I'm hurting. I don't want to feel anything but when I get so depressed I'll turn everything off so I am numb. The bad part about that is because I know I'm still in here some where wanting help and hope. But I continue to cut till I feel something. And still nothing. I don't want to be here anymore i guess I could say. There's many people that would want me to stay I just don't realize it in the moment. I need pulled out of this dark void but the only person who can really do that is me. My girl Friend helps me a lot. She's great and I love her but I also don't want to drag her through my problems. I am going to truly try and work on myself because I was actually planning on doing the deed this week. That's all I wanted was to be gone. But i didn't and Im not and im kind of happy im here still.

ue46ne,1651177108,Question about antidepressants?,"So I’ve been on various antidepressants now, the one I’m currently taking are the only ones without severe painful side effects, also the only ones that got rid of physical exhaustion, but ever since I’m on them I’ve started having severe depressive mental breakdowns. First it was like three in one week but now i experience them almost every single day. I’m not exaggerating when I say mental breakdowns btw, it’s genuinely VERY bad. Like to the point where I’d rather die than become a billionaire even though I know that I’ll only feel like this for a few hours, simply because I’m in so much pain that I don’t think it’s worth it.

ue32zp,1651174159,A need to get a lot off my chest,"I’ve had suicidal thoughts on and off since I was 16. I’m 20y/o now. I try my best to do the right things with my life. I have a job (that I hate) but it’s helping me pay my way through college (which I also hate because it’s a money grab and a scam) and I workout six times a week to try and be healthy. I played football and ran track throughout high school and pushed myself through a serious back injury so I basically live with permanent sciatica and back pain. I’ve been told by others that I’m strong and this that and the third but it’s all a mask. I can fake my way though the day being “confident” and sometimes even happy but once I’m by myself it feels like I’m drowning. I realize that all this is so meaningless and all I really want out of life is to be happy. I have goals and I truly want to reach them but I’m not even sure if it would make me happy to do so. I have maybe three friends left since I grew apart from everyone else and I have nothing to really talk about with them so most days I go about my routine and talk to no one except coworkers or the occasionally convo at the gym. Like I said, I’ve dealt with suicidal thoughts before and I’m at the point where I know I won’t go through with anything because I want to be of service to the world before I go, however if I died tomorrow I wouldn’t be upset. I’ve never been to therapy but I know that it won’t help. I don’t want to be on meds either because that’ll just make things worse. I just feel like I know what life already has to offer and it’s not appetizing enough to want to live a painful and sufferable life for a few brief moments of happiness that aren’t even a guarantee.
