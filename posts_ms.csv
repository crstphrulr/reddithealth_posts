uel7sk,1651236602,Fatigue after lumbar puncture,"Hi everyone. \n\nI have now had two lumbar punctures done. The first one was done bedside when I was in the hospital years ago and the second one was done this past Tuesday in radiology. \n\nAfter the first one I had the dreadful spinal headache. It lasted about 9 days. No one told me about the blood patch so I just suffered through it. \n\nThis time I don’t have the headache but I’ve been really tired. I know it’s normal to be tired the first day or two but yesterday (day three) I went to work and ended up leaving after a few hours. I was so tired. \n\nI’m contemplating not going to work today. I don’t want to go in for just a few hours, wear myself out, and come home. \n\nI can’t seem to find much about people having fatigue issues days after their lumbar puncture. I’m just curious if anyone else has had this fatigue issue and if there was anything that helped them. \n\nThank you in advance for your help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/uel7sk/fatigue_after_lumbar_puncture/
uel32g,1651236155,"Hello, everybody. I’m new here but looking for advice.","Greetings! \n\nThis is a little wild but it all started a few years ago when I came home from a mission trip. I got the vaccines that were necessary to get before I went to Africa. I was on malaria meds for about a month as a precaution too. I came back and my entire body wigged out on me. I had so many problems and had a team of doctors that tried to figure out what was going on. It was awful and something I don’t want to experience again. However, my neurologist at the time ordered MRIs on my neck &amp; brain. He ruled out MS back in 2018. My birth mother has MS for a little background info. Anyhow, I started to get really bad migraines, burning sensations in my head and all over my body, sensitivity to light, tingles, pin and needles sensations, sharp shooting pain, my legs would shake as in tremors almost, my nerves felt like they were over stimulated and on fire, my whole body would itch (sometimes it still does), really bad foot/toe cramps where I can’t move my foot, diminished feeling on my left side of my body, my left side of my face goes numb, left eye problems, stomach problems, heart issues, I couldn’t even go out in the sun because I felt like my arms would be on fire, and so forth. Fast forward to 2019, I had another Mri. There were a few bulging discs in my neck now, which made a lot of sense. I continue to go to my chiropractor and massage therapist for pain relief. \n\nRecently, I just got another neck MRI and it showed NO more bulging discs but had the diagnosis of MS. I go for a brain MRI on May 10th. So my question for all of you is this: has this happened to anybody before? Can the doctors or radiologists give MS as a diagnosis on a cervical scan? I’m so confused because they ruled it out years ago. \n\nJust looking for a bit of advice and want to see if anybody else had this happen to them. Has anybody got the run around then got diagnosed? I’m nervous. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/uel32g/hello_everybody_im_new_here_but_looking_for_advice/

uehbrk,1651221028,A sad story of sorts,"I was dating this girl at the time I got diagnosed with MS, right at the height of lockdown. I was going through my recovery phase from the awful relapse I had (double vision, facial numbness). I didn't react that much to it at first, but as the months passed, I became more bitter and angry at my circumstances. Angry that I had to be driven everywhere by my friends, and angry that I was sick for life, even if I didn't feel like it. I turned to my girlfriend for support, but unfortunately, everything got very toxic from there. \n\nShe began seeing an older man, as in a sugar daddy/baby type of relationship. But I stupidly decided to try and keep this going, because I knew she badly needed money. However, this seemingly flipped a switch of toxicity in her; she became extremely controlling, almost to the point of stalking. I snapped one day and said I couldn't take it anymore. That's where I should've cut off contact, but I was guilted into keeping contact, because I was vulnerable like she was. \n\nI was hurled insult after insult by her through the month I tried to talk things out. But the breaking point was when she blamed my illness for our breakup. Something I couldn't control, was suddenly becoming the cause of me turning into an asshole. And I was selfish for focusing on healing from that instead of giving her attention. And that stuck with me for a while. The person I once loved, was throwing that at me.\n\nIt's been a long time since that happened, but why am I telling the story now? Because it's a lesson to turn to those that you know will support you in your biggest times of need. Friends, family, whatever. I tried turning to a significant other, and got cheating and illness-blaming. It hurt, but it taught me a valuable lesson about the people who do truly love and care for me",https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/uehbrk/a_sad_story_of_sorts/
ueg95h,1651216006,Finally getting treatment (long story),"I’m a 24 yr old male and I’ve had a rough journey with ms and still do. It’s a very long story but Ive had symptoms for years (around the most 17-20yrs old) and didn’t take them serious then one day in august of 2021(I was 23) I had the worst migraine and blurry vision/ double vision and I couldn’t speak at all / function I had to stop working I went to the hospital didn’t get helped went back to another one still no help then I went to an neurologist in September ( worst neurologist I’ve ever had) he wasn’t a help at all in finding what’s wrong with me then I seen an ophthalmologist for my vision issues in October (she helped me closer to my diagnosis) things were narrowed down to lupus and ms. Lupus came up negative but I still didn’t know what was going on the only thing I knew was I had 10 lesions huge on my brain that looked like the size of tumors. I was constantly in pain, depressed, emotional and I tried every medication my neurologist prescribed. It got me more sick and drained so then I tried weed (wasn’t a pot smoker before) to see if it would help me and man it did. It got me able to deal with symptoms and I started to think again express myself and eat again so I stopped talking all these pills and only weed. It may cause others to feel out of it but it helped me find who I was I was able to move with little pain and function a little but still suffering . Fast forward November my neurologist recommended I do a spinal tap ( he did it wrong caused me to have another relapse but still got the results he needed) I tested positive for ms in December of 2021 he told me that in January 2022 I could start treatment but I never did at all this all happened until march of 2022 he said he wasn’t sure that I might really have ms I believe I did because I felt like there was so many things different about me but couldn’t figure it out I couldn’t run really good in HS or jump correctly with my legs and would fall a lot as a kid over thin air and had a lot of brain fog. I knew it could be it ms I joined this group and read a lot of your story’s and it give me hope that I can fight but I got more sick due to lack of treatment January was my worst month after the spinal tap I got just as sick as I did at the beginning but I’ve read many post in this group and it made a impact on me because my family took it so lightly I want to give up cause my family implied I don’t have time to have ms I have to be the provider. I got sent for a second in February 2022 the doctor didn’t believe it because the lesions wasn’t enough and the since the spinal tap was done wrong it made it worse for future doctors to read it. So I left my doctor in march and wrote a review on him being honest and he threatened me to remove it and I did not. nobody with a chronic illness needs to be treated like that. a friend of mines who has ms referred me to to a good ms specialist they helped me so much within a month and did the mri of my brain over again and found my lesions increased in size explaining my walking getting worst and a new relapse. I just finished getting all the test over tested positive for Lyme turns out it was a false Lyme test so then I got another spinal tap but done the right way I didn’t get sick this time and recovered fast and a PET scan from another neurologist because they thought I had brain cancer (I know it’s a lot) because of the size of lesions but everything came back as MS so I start DMT on Ocrevus on may 6 and I’m so happy. If you read the whole thing my advice is don’t give up even if you get stuck in the process of being diagnosed I  almost did and I’m glad I didn’t",https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/ueg95h/finally_getting_treatment_long_story/

ue2873,1651171835,Various Newcomer Questions,"Hello everyone, I'm a newcomer to our lovely disease.\n\nI get a lot of conflicting information from my neurologist, books, websites. I have a few remaining questions:\n\n* T. Jock Murray writes about cold treatment. Would room-temperature bathtubbing be a sensible replacement for the air-conditioning in the summer? Like bathtubbing for 20 minutes every 2 hours. We even have a swimming pool in this building, how much would swimming help? T. Jock Murray somewhat recommends it, but I would have to specifically make time for it. If there is no benefit to it, I don't want to make time for it. And what does ""cold"" mean? Bathtubbing in room-temperature water already feels cold to me.\n* Wahls writes that, although we don't have to be too strict on food and dosage, we should be strict to never have diary, gluten, or eggs. My neurologist has me eat flaxseed oil every morning with cottage cheese. That's diary. He says that I shouldn't just take the flaxseed oil, that would immediately get out of the body, so should be taken with some fat. Does it have to be cottage cheese?\n* Jenny Feng from the U of Louisville says in a presentation that inflammation prevents remyelination. That means how nazi do I have to be about inflammation prevention? Is there any way to assess how much ""remyelination prevention"" can be caused by inflammation? I still don't quite understand to what extent inflammation is not only a \*consequence\* of MS, but also a \*cause\*: it prevents remyelination. I phrase it as this: if I can cope with the symptoms of inflamation, should I still be concerned about preventing it (because it prevents remyelination)? I definitely \*do\* want to attempt remyelination, if that is possible. So should I prevent inflammation at all cost? Or can some inflammation be tolerated without ruining all efforts of remyelination?\n* I saw a YouTube in which Terry Wahls was cooking with bacon. Aren't we supposed to prevent salt?\n* I see that several posters in this sub tear the Wahls Protocol apart. I also don't like to read recipe books, or even following recipes (too much work, I like it plain and simple, I can't manage a dozen ingredients, too much time and shuffling stuff around). But unless her entire story is faked, she \*has\* successfully healed, got rid of the zero-gravity wheelchair, and could bike 20 miles after nine months. Some say that she doesn't disclose that she is taking medication. Ok, but then still, I think that is an enormous success, I can't imagine that medications alone can bring you from zero-gravity wheelchair to being able to bike 20 miles, so I think there must be \*something\* that points towards a nutritional component of her healing. And what Wahls has in common with Swank is the consumption of large amounts of green veggies and the reduction of polysaturated fats.\n* Wahls writes about electric treatment having been successful on her, but I don't find any details.

I’ve read varying things on what constitutes an MS diagnosis and I know there are likely additional tests they’ll need to do to get a definitive answer. Ive long suspected that I have some sort of autoimmune issue (muscle/joint pain that will come and go, fatigue, sensitivity to heat, etc.) and have gone down the trail of being checked out for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis with no real answers other than everything looked fine and to just reduce stress as much as possible.

And I don't know what to do anymore. \n\nI was diagnosed when I was 8 years old but after that first flare up my parents adopted total lifestyle changes and I honestly forget I had MS. It wasn't a part of life for over a decade. This changed a year and a half ago, a couple months after I transferred from community college to a four-year university. I was pretty anxious and lonely as was most people during the main covid quarantine but started getting very obviously lethargic and fatigued. Thought I was just being lazy or tired. feet started getting very numb. couldn't even skate anymore because of bad coordination and I'm ashamed at how long it took for me to go like ""oh yeah I have MS"". \n\nI saw a neurologist for the first time from over a decade that summer and there were new lesions but said that I should find a new dr near my university which would entail switching out insurance coverage, etc. and this took an obscene amount of time. Then getting my first primary care physician appt took a lot of time. and so did getting a neurology referral. I finally got an appt but it is in JUNE. \n\nAll during this time I've been going in and out of flare ups. I've literally woken up on countless days and feel so fatigued and foggy that in my brain I'm like, dude get tf up you have class and work and studying. And you promised so-and-so you'd hang out. And I just don't. I have so much anxiety in my head about exams and grades but instead of getting up and doing anything about it, I just wallow in a ball of debilitating stress. These periodic mental issues coupled with the obnoxious physical issues are driving my insane. I can't even properly pipette in lab without feeling exhausted it makes me cry. I try to exercise and do Pilates and take supplements and eat very healthy but for what\n\nMy GPA is literal shit. I didn't even have the option to take a gap quarter/year because I'm all out of financial aid. I graduate this summer but then what? What kind of grad program is going to accept a person who's final two years of undergrad are literal trash!

My original neuro was a generalist who did get me through my original diagnosis but I just never felt like we were on the same page. She did little to nothing in terms of baseline functional tests. She recommended less-effective treatments. She eventually agreed to prescribe Kesimpta, but only after I suggested it as an option. (and the next appointment she followed up by asking why I chose that option and tried to scare me about the potential side effects) She shrugged when I asked about extra covid precautions or preventive treatments.\n\nThe new guy is an MS specialist. He immediately did the full battery of functional tests. He talked through my experiences thus far in detail and asked a lot of great questions. He was really happy that I was on Kesimpta already and said that if he had to pick something for himself that would likely be high on the list. He explained that he comes from the school of thought of doing aggressive treatment early to prevent the development of further disability, which is exactly what I was looking for. I'm not much of a crier usually, but I was nearly in tears at how vindicated I felt.\n\nThank you to everyone here for sharing your stories and helping to give me an idea what an MS doctor \*should\* act like so I could advocate for myself.

This wasn’t a shock to me because I was told I had a lesion during an MRI I had done a couple years ago in college- likely due to migraines. \n\nToday at the request of my neurologist I went back to get another MRI- this time with contrast, at the ER since my neurology clinic was booking out so far. When I got my updated results there was no mention of these lesions in the notes. I asked the ER doctor about them and he said that he assumed that the lesions had disappeared since they weren’t noted on the MRI report. Does this sound right? The MRI was in comparison to the initial one conducted two weeks ago, so I am not sure if they didn’t mention it because there were no changes or if they truly disappeared like the ER doctor said. \n\nMy neurologist isn’t available for close to a month to interpret the MRI results for me, otherwise I would just wait.

Been feeling this way since 2020, thought it was carpal tunnel, but finally went to the doc and they did an MRI which showed lesions on my spine. Looking back now after reading other symptoms people have posted about in here, I know other symptoms I have had are textbook of MS like the MS hug feeling, double vision, fatigue, brain fog. To be honest, I'm just grateful to have a diagnosis and an answer. \n\nAny advice? I'm going for my next round of MRIs at the beginning of May. My parents want me to get a second opinion as well from an actual MS neurology specialist.\n\nAlso, has anyone had feeling recover in their hands?

I didn't evergreen know what MS was until after my MRI, when my doctor called me. Even then, I had to Google it to know what it was. Well, I'm happy to say that I've managed to raise $1,000 for the National MS Society. I went to the WalkMS event feeling like I was part of an exclusive club, one that is full of struggle but also full of triumph. I've never felt so proud. I walked 3 miles and my body felt like ass, but my spirit was on cloud 9. As hard as this is, it felt comforting to be surrounded by people who are living with this disease and know the struggle, just in different ways. I didn't feel like I was being stared at with my cane, I felt like people around me just...understand. I felt at home with others who understood and didn't judge the disease. It was so nice to see Teams that were so supportive of those living with MS. Their enthusiasm was intoxicating and, for the first time in a long time, it felt like things were good. That I was doing something worth the energy I spent on it. \n\nAnd my partner had this ""I walk for..."" sign on his chest, and he wrote ""My loving girlfriend"". He refused to take it off all day and wore it proudly. I felt so loved and so appreciated. It felt like he was PROUD of me, like he was showing me off. It's hard to feel like I'm worth showing off sometimes, but I just felt the love that everyone had for their loved ones with MS.

ubdnoj,1650864465,TLTR: Seeking advice on advocating for my health,"Hello everyone!\n\nI apologize in advance if this post would be appropriate in another subreddit, so please let me know if I should take down this post. I'm searching for advice on the best ways I can advocate for myself as I've been dismissed by specialists, even my PCP that I really like. Since over a year ago, I've been having neurological issues/symptoms that have not gone away. I actually had a few months break where some of my symptoms went away, but recently some symptoms have come back as well as new ones. Anyway, I was afraid of having an MRI done last year because of not being able to hold still if I had a seizure so my neurologist said I can get it done whenever I'm ready. After going over my symptoms, hour-long EKG, and history, my neurologist diagnosed me with pseudoseizures due to trauma and said that anxiety can manifest itself in physical forms. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel that is bullshit because I know what anxiety feels like for me and I used to battle with it and depression when I was younger due to growing up in an abusive environment. I've had years of healing/recovery with counseling and medication where my depression and anxiety was no longer hindering my life. Before my first seizure last year, I've never had anxiety manifest itself in uncontrollable physical ways. I also know my triggers for my anxiety, but these physical symptoms I cannot control, I swear I'm not making them up!\n\nI have some symptoms (new &amp; old) that come on throughout the day or week: occasional eye pain/vision issues, sudden head pain/fuzziness, sensitivity to light, severe fatigue/weakness/weighed down feeling in limbs, memory issues, trouble speaking, pain/aches/uncomfortable tingling sensations that come on suddenly in my limbs, collapsing to floor due to sudden weakness/loss of feeling in legs, difficulty breathing at times, waking up multiple times during the night in confusion, chest pain, instantly forgetting what someone says, feeling the need to pee a lot but not much comes out, hearing fading in and out, smelling burnt rubber/smoke, flashes of light with eyes open/closed, severe sleepiness, severe dizziness, sudden numbness/droopy in side of face and arm, and waking up from my sleep having spasms/seizures. I don't know if this is helpful or not to include, but my great aunt has epilepsy and my mom's twin sister has recently been diagnosed with MS after a very long battle of testing and seeing doctors. My aunt told me that she started having seizures in her 20's and said that doctors couldn't figure out the root cause of it until now, years down the road. She also told me that even though seizures are a less common symptom of MS, she urges me to get checked out since I'm going through similar things she did. I'm not saying I have MS because I wouldn't know, but I know something is wrong with me.\n\nA couple months ago, I saw my PCP a few times and let her know that I felt ready to have a MRI done now because things aren't getting better, and I've had new symptoms to report. I also don't want to go into my school program this year with my issues and not know what is truly wrong with my body. When I saw my doctor for my issues, she performed a physical exam. She wrote in her notes, "" Extremities: normal LE peripheral strength against resistance but few beat of clonus after each motion, and hyperreflexic at the patellar and calcaneal tendons b/l but after something of a delay (second tap) - which may be volitional."" I remember my legs trembling and it being harder to push against my doctors hands for resistance than usual, and a delay in my reflexes. Just so you know, I saw an eye specialist who said my eyes look fine after lots of testing, and my PCP said that my head MRI results didn't indicate MS.\n\nOn top of my symptoms, I just feel very unwell now and don't want to move much anymore as it feels so tiring. My energy levels have completely gone downhill since a few months ago....I'll wake up and after a few hours of being up, I want to go back to bed so bad, it feels like I can't stay awake for much of the day now. Over the past several weeks, I noticed I'm having more aches/weird sensations shooting down my limbs, hands, and feet. Gradually, it feels like my body is shutting down on me and everyday I'm trying to fight what I'm feeling/experiencing. About a month ago and again a week ago, I was the most dizzy I've ever been and was falling over and couldn't stand/walk right. My bf had to take over my share of fixing dinner because I couldn't even lift my arms to reach for cups...felt like I had no strength (has happened a few times). I was trying to fight staying awake because it felt like I was on the verge of passing out for a few hours. For a few minutes during that time, I also felt overwhelmed with pins and needles feeling in my whole face and roof of my mouth and couldn't hear well.\n\nI will be copying &amp; pasting the conversation I had with my PCP a few months ago because I'm having such a hard time determining if I need to be more pushy for my health or not. I've been researching tests that can help show abnormalities in my body and reading people's experiences with their health journey. Even though I feel my doctor didn't directly say ""no"" for my test requests near the end of the conversation, I don't know if it would make sense to request that she document her refusal since she suggested I get a second opinion from a neurologist? I've been feeling more frustrated lately and don't know if I want to continue seeing my regular doctor. I want to be respectful to my doctor, but I also don't want to get written off/not taken seriously that this is more than ""anxiety/trauma"". I remember when I saw my PCP in person, she said that if the MRI comes back normal, she suggested I start therapy as that can help me get better. I had years of therapy growing up which has helped immensely, but I'm sad it's in my record that she believes all I need is therapy again.\n\nHere's my conversation with my PCP...\n\n**Me**: I saw an eye specialist yesterday and he said that everything looks fine, but he wanted me to schedule in 2 weeks so he can look at my optic nerve. Since I spoke with you last, my symptoms have gotten worse. I had pain in my left eye again yesterday and was dealing with severe fatigue all day. I keep having trouble speaking here and there and I feel severely weak. I could hardly sleep this last night and kept waking up having spasms/seizures. I usually wake up having spasms, but now they seem more violent and disturbing my sleep even more. Everytime I kept waking up this last night and right now, I feel very nauseous and dizzy. I'm also having pain and uncomfortable tingling sensations throughout my body. I woke up to a bright big circle of light in my right eye this morning. Should I let eye specialist know about this since it happened in my right eye? I forgot to mention to you that several months ago, the right side of my face went numb and felt droopy. I feel very unwell and I don't know if it's because I can't sleep even though I've not had much sleep before and been ok. I feel extra trembly and don't want to move much as it feels so tiring. So many of my symptoms are not new, some have reappeared, and some are now worse in a short amount of time. My head also feels very fuzzy and uncomfortable in a way.\n\n**PCP**: Thanks for reaching out. Unfortunately if things are this bad I think you ought to come in to the emergency room and tell them what's happening, to try to get the MRI imaging as soon as possible. They can also test for COVID if they think that's warranted. I would have you tell them you seem to be having worsening seizure activity, and they'll probably check with neurology as well. You might need to follow up with your previous neurologist on an out patient (in clinic) way. I wish I could help more immediately, but it sounds like you need to be seen and having some imaging, and the ER is the fastest way to do that.\n\n**Me**: Thank you for letting me know. I'm at the ER right now and tried my best to tell the doctor what's going on. The right side of my face and right arm feel numb which started an hour or so ago. Dr. said that he doesn't see anything concerning and said he saw that I have a referral for MRI later. He said before he sends me home, he will take a scan of my eyes. He said I can follow up with you. It's so hard for me to remember and focus on what I need to say because so much has been happening to me again and I feel like I'm being dismissed like last year all over again. I also showed the Dr. your message and he quickly gave me back the phone, so I'm not sure he actually read, but I tried to tell him that you told me to come to the ER. The Dr. also said that because I'm 23, he wasn't concerned about my symptoms. He kept asking me over and over again (it was infuriating) if I had concerns about anything, and I did my best to tell him the symptoms that bother me the most and do worry me. I'm home now and I became severely dizzy again and couldn't get up for a minute...I felt like I was being knocked over on the floor. Is this something that is concerning to go to ER even though I wouldn't get help again? As much as I'm used to alot of symptoms, some I am not used to getting worse and new ones, but I also don't want to ignore what I'm experiencing in case it's life threatening. I don't mind with the weekend passing, I'm just not sure what I shouldn't ignore till I get more help.\n\n**PCP**: I'm sorry this was so challenging - they really should have just listened to you and evaluated your symptoms today, not seemingly fought you so much about it. I do think some rest is a good idea and I'll plan to reach out to the neurologist you saw previously so we can both try to formulate a plan to help. I do think the imaging is still a good idea, so get that scheduled as soon as you're able (the MRI). If you have severely worsening pain over the weekend, the ER is still the right place to be, in spite of what push-back they might try to give you.\n\n**Me**: I had my MRI done today and want to thank you for putting in the referral. I wanted to bring to your attention that some of my more bothersome symptoms that feel worse since I've seen you are nauseousness, dizziness, balance, weird head sensations, severe tiredness, memory issues, verbal communication, and achy/numbness/heaviness feelings in my limbs. My eye pain has gotten better, though I still feel pain here and there and my head pain isn't as bad as it was for a few days. I want to let you know that I'd be interested in completing an Evoked Potential Test and Lumbar Puncture/spinal fluid test that may help to provide information for my neurological issues. Would I be able to have a referral for these tests as well? I understand if I should make a follow up appointment with you or a neurologist about these matters. I am worried about having trouble speaking and not seeming tipsy at my dental hygiene interview that’s coming up, but I will do my best to practice before then. Thank you for all the time and support you've given to help me. I appreciate all that you do and thank you for caring about my well being. I hope you have a great rest of your week and take care.\n\n**PCP**: Thanks for all the additional information. I connected again with your previous neurologist to help review/interpret your MRI results and be sure we're taking any necessary next steps. She really doesn't think what you're describing is indicative of Multiple Sclerosis and indeed the MRI doesn't show any evidence of demyelination (the loss of tissue that helps with nerve signal transmission, and is characteristic of MS). I wouldn't move to doing a lumbar puncture, etc just yet or without further neurology input. Your optic nerves and eye tissues looked fine as well, and there was nothing immediately worrisome (no brain tumor, no stroke, nothing of that sort). You do appear to have what may be a small benign growth in one inner ear canal, and it's possible that could be causing some of your symptoms - they can give dizziness, sense of imbalance, hearing changes and possibly headache, and sometimes facial sensation or weakness issues. I would still hesitate to attribute all that you describe to just this, but there is certainly some potential overlap. Your previous neurologist mentioned potentially consulting with neurosurgery about this finding and potential options - including removal, I believe. Would you like me to set that up? I am hopeful it could happen pretty quickly.\n\n**Me**: Thank you for contacting my neurologist and getting back to me. I am interested to have that set up, thank you for offering. I saw that an impression has been updated for the study result of the MRI. I saw the first note says, ""Differential includes vestibular schwannoma"", which I assume must be the benign growth in the ear canal? However, I noticed that it says for the 2nd note it states, ""2.Nonspecific ill-defined T2 FLAIR hyperintensity of bilateral thalami. No diffusion restriction or enhancement. Differential includes Wernicke's encephalopathy. Recommend clinical correlation."" Does this mean that ""Differential includes Wernicke's encephalopathy"", that is also present? I wanted to bring this up because I didn't see these notes until later today.\n\n**PCP**: I reviewed that other commentary about the thalamus with your neurologist and she actually noted this is just a variant of normal - she has no concern for Wernicke's encephalopathy (and she'd be more versed in that diagnosis than I). The radiologists who read imaging are sort of obligated to include a laundry list of things that any finding could be (that's called a ""differential diagnosis"") but their mentioning does NOT mean that that is what they are. ""Clinical correlation"" is the combination of what you actually know about the patient and his/her symptoms and then how the imaging looks. Hope that makes sense. I will put in the referral to neurosurgery today.\n\n**Me**: Ok, thank you. I will keep in mind questions to ask during the consultation. Thank you for the insight on clinical correlation. Thank you for putting in referral for neurosurgery today. On top of being so exhausted and out of breath doing things that don't require much energy/movement, I'm having a hard time breathing too. It feels very exhausting just to breathe. I'm resting and it feels like it takes alot to breathe, so it makes me want to take longer time to inhale and exhale. I also feel a sensation that my chest is being tightened/weighed down where I can't take long breaths...I just notice this is bothering me.\n\nI would like to request a MRI screening of whole spine and an Evoked Potential Test. Thank you and have a great day.\n\n**PCP**: Unfortunately I cannot just order those things, there has to be a reason for them that your insurance approves. Let's first see what neurosurgery thinks re: the MRI findings. Your neurologist was thinking you might also benefit from a second neurology opinion, potentially with our CHI Franciscan colleagues. I'll put in a referral for that as well - if that provider thinks you need these other tests they may be able to get them covered.\n\nWhen my doctor brought up that it appears I have a benign growth in my ear canal that may be contributing to some of my symptoms...could this really be causing everything I'm battling with?? I feel deep down inside that if anything, it may be contributing to some symptoms, but not the big picture. I'm tired of being dismissed ""because I'm only 23"" and seem fine on the outside. I also want to share that not everyday is the same and gets so bad, but I never know how the day will progress. Also, I have shared with my doctors office that my insurance has never had to approve seeing a specialist or having a test done...I called my insurance just to double check this and they also said that they don't approve referrals and that I should be able to have what I need done. I have a scheduled an appointment with a new neurologist on April 27, and have written down most of what I experience if she wants to focus on that. Should I bother bringing up having a MRI for my spine and an Evoked Potential Test done to the new neurologist or follow what she wants to focus on? In your experience, are there other tests I should request? I've never had an ear infection and a few weeks ago I went to an urgent care doctor who prescribed me antibiotic drops because I had a bacterial infection in both my ears (sharp pain in both ears and felt sick). I'm thinking I'll bring this up to her since I still have occasional ear pain in both my ears and am not sure the infection has 100% disappeared.\n\nI've written a long post, so thank you for taking the time to read and hear me. I really appreciate being able to share this with you as it feels better getting it off my chest. I don’t expect anyone to reply to my long post, but I appreciate being able to post here as it has been on my mind for awhile. If you have questions, I will respond as soon as I can. I hope you and your loved ones are doing well. Thank you so much :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/ubdnoj/tltr_seeking_advice_on_advocating_for_my_health/

Undiagnosed and Now Afraid.,"Hey guys I (20F, Undiagnosed) am now experiencing possible MS hug.\n\nI had Optic Neuritis a month ago and saw a couple ophthalmologists telling me that they're concerned if it might be MS. I'm getting the MRI done for the Orbits and Brain on the 5th of May. However I previously got a brain MRI in the ER when I got the Optic Neuritis &amp; Dizziness (they did not check orbits) and it was clear. (This was a month ago) They had no explanation for my eye issue but after following up with Ophthalmologists it seems it is Optic Neuritis. \n\nI was quite skeptical that I had MS, since I was told that Optic Neuritis isn't exclusive to MS. I had just had Covid 2 weeks prior. I didn't worry too much about it. \n\nBut now, few days ago I started to experiencing this awful squeezing pain around my rigcage right below my breasts. It feels like if I wore my bra or a waist trimmer really tight or that my muscles are in a middle of a workout and straining. It happens intermittently with me and it's happening to me right now. I was also walking down the hallway the other day and felt my right leg feel really weakened like I was losing the ability to walk on it. It frightened me, but this only lasted a minute or so. (Don't know if this is MS related. But never had this happen to me before.)\n\nI am seeing my primary care doctor on Tuesday about this. I was curious and searched up the symptoms. First thing that popped up was MS hug.\n\nNow, this just got real for me. I honestly don't know what to believe because my brain MRI was clear a month and a half ago. I will finally get the MRI of my orbits and my optic nerve very soon though. I'm afraid this may be MS, but I do not want to jump the gun on this one.\n\nI guess another symptom was my arm or leg feeling a bit weak, but I feel like this is just from anxiety. I have slight general weakness ever since all this happening. I can still carry and hold things, but now holding things feel more of a chore, and that I just want to let go of it so I don't have to hold it anymore (example: my phone).\n\nMy vision from optic neuritis I feel like is not 100%, it looks like it most of the time but when I close each eye I can still tell my left eye which was unaffected has brighter lights and colors. I am now seeing glare in lights that I have never experienced before and having slight blurry vision.\n\nWondering if anybody has any advice or have ever experiencing the same thing prediagnosis.\n\nThank you so much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/uba2ck/now_experiencing_ms_hug_alongside_on_undiagnosed/
uba0jw,1650851663,looking for help with reaching out. 21f,"Hello everyone, \n\nThis is my first time posting here and it may be a bit lengthy but I hope that the community here will have some advice for me.\n\nI have been tossing around the idea of having MS for around 7 years but I have not seen anyone for a diagnosis.\n\nThe reason that I am writing this is due to a tweet that I just saw on Twitter talking abt the link between Epstein Barr (mono) and MS. Here is a link to the tweet https://twitter.com/IppokratisAnge1/status/1517854036472573952?t=K8tQ7CZhpgJxbgG9U7eDZA&amp;s=19\n\nThis made me think as I have had mono. I first got the positive test in early February and I was extremely fatigued for all of February, March and I feel it starting up again as I have been so tired and have had a sore throat for the past two days. My mother also has MS. She was diagnosed in 1999. She also had mono when she was 16 and spent 2 weeks in the hospital due to mono. \n\nMy mother has gotten worse over the years. She can walk for a few minutes at a time with the assistance of two canes, two braces and a walk aid. The rest of the time she is in a wheelchair. She is 54.\n\nI am 21, will be 22 this fall and I would like to get an MRI. However, I am worried that I will not be taken seriously as my symptoms are not as severe as other people. I have noticed that occasionally my left foot will drop when walking and I sort of trip. I have tingling in my legs when I am in a position for too long. I have also noticed that my hands shake. My memory is also bad but I do not know how much stock to take in that as I suffered a lot of abuse when I was younger and that affects one's memory. \n\nSince I look fine physically, I am worried about being dismissed and that I am simply stressed. I have a lot going on that is causing me stress. I am a full time student at a community college taking  5 classes (16 credits) to graduate early and transfer (reconsidering transferring because I feel like shit), am stressed about the transfer process, applying for scholarships and financial aid as well as taking care of things around the house (cleaning, yard) as I am still at home. My mother can't do anything, and my brothers refuse (parents are divorced as father is physically abusive). \n\nI am also black, and that is another thing that scares me. My mother is white so she does not have that concern but I look like a black person. \n\nWith that being said, do you think I should try?\n\n I feel like I may be at the beginning stages (if MS applies to me) but I would like to be proactive as this is freaking me out. I know deep down that something is not right. \n\nAlso, here is some more information for context. Again, I am 21. My health insurance is through Medicaid and I am in Maryland. I have not yet been able to find a family care physician for adults so I am still associated with my pediatricians office. Due to my age and how the office is split, I am only able to see a nurse practitioner(who I find to be an unkind person). \n\nThank you so much for reading all this and I look forward to any advice/suggestions. \n\nIf clarification or more information is needed, please do not hesitate to ask.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/uba0jw/looking_for_help_with_reaching_out_21f/

I just want some advice on how I should handle it because it pertains to me having MS and the lasting effects of that. \n\nMy boyfriend started dating me after my diagnosis, so I was pretty upfront with him about it and what my life is like now (because for me, MS had changed how I walk and my stamina). Fast forward 7 months into the relationship, things have improved a bit but not to a noticeable degree for someone else. \n\nHe really likes to attend events, mainly music festivals which require a lot of walking. I can walk about 10 minutes before my foot drop returns and things get a bit difficult for me. I’ve gone to these events with him because they’re important to him-but I end up feeling worse for ware by the end of them, have to take many breaks, sit a lot, and not drink at all because alcohol makes my symptoms worse. \n\nIt’s become apparent to him that these events are a chore for me, as he says, and that bothers him. He feels like I “throw in the towel” on these things and don’t try to accommodate my situation so I can enjoy this stuff with him. Some examples from him on how to accommodate this stuff is to have him pull me around on a skateboard or use a wheelchair at these events but he doesn’t understand why none of that feels enjoyable. I don’t want to be in a wheelchair because 1. I don’t have one, and 2. I don’t really need one. Pulling me through a dense crowd also just seems stressful and dangerous. \n\nIt depresses me to see everyone around me dancing and jumping and running when I can’t. I don’t want to sit in a crowd of able bodied people as a constant reminder of what I lost.\n\nI feel like I don’t often have to think about this stuff until he asks me to go to these events or to go on long walks. It hurts my feelings when he says I throw in the towel because I feel like I am trying every day that I get up and go to work and come home and anytime I go on a bike ride with him and to events with him knowing what it will make me feel like. \n\nSo I guess I’m asking, from the outside looking in, do you think our lifestyles are just incompatible as an active person and as someone who lives with permanent disability? Should I end it before it becomes toxic?\n\nThanks for reading 💕",https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/uaxcg7/advice_but_no_tough_love_please/

uaargf,1650735930,The 5%,"Two years ago I started experiencing symptoms that were so in my face I couldn’t ignore it. Literally. The left side of my face went numb. Several days later I felt drunk and my hands felt weird so I went to the ER. \n\nThe doctor came into the room after ordering an MRI and said, “you might have MS. Have a follow up with your doctor. Good night.” And walked out of the room 🤯🤯🤯 the fuck? I was hysterical. \n\nThat same week I started the Wahls diet, and so the rabbit hole began. The Wahls diet isn’t perfect but it gave me a nice frame work. Inbetween visits with neurologists and several MRIs I did a lot of blood work with different doctors, explored my deficiencies, allergies, sensitivities, and the critters living inside my stomach. \n\nI was “healthy” prior. Meaning- I worked out a lot but also allowed myself to be very stressed all the time. And I also ate whatever the hell I felt like. \n\nAlong with all my blood work and dietary changes I made drastic changes in my lifestyle. I started meditating every morning and night. I started regular massage therapy, acupuncture, breath work, and yoga. Anything and everything to calm my nervous system down. \n\nI logged everyday of my life for two years. I logged what I ate, how I felt, any symptoms I was experiencing, physical activity, my mood. Etc. eventually, I started picking up patterns. \n\nStress was the single biggest trigger for my symptoms, migraines, and the well being of my digestion. \n\nCertain foods that aggravated my GI would also trigger all my neuro symptoms. \n\nI grieved the loss of my care free life. I grieved not being able to eat what I use to love. I grieved not really being able to go out and eat and drink. I grieved for an old me. \n\nI got the hang of things though. I slowly started working out again now that I could hear and see and feel my body in a completely different way. I can identify subtle inflammation. Sometimes it’s good and other times it’s a warning sign. Over exertion (physically or emotionally) will trigger a flare up. \n\nI spent countless hours working with naturopath doctors and reading books on regulating my hormones, immune system, and GI with medicinal herbs and food. \n\nEvery now and then I’d still get my ass kicked by a migraine or by stress and all my symptoms would flare… but I had tools in my back pocket and I could bring down the aggravation fairly quickly. \n\nAfter two years of no new lesions with MRIs every 4-6 months- one teeny tiny lesion popped up in my spine. My original MRIs showed two brain lesions. Which didn’t fit the criteria for an official diagnosis. With a new lesion also in a new location- the diagnosis was made. \n\nMy neurologist is not a specialist in MS. I listened to her advice and she recommended copaxane immediately. I scheduled an appointment with a MS specialist at a MS clinic for a second opinion on treatment plans.\n\nHere’s the curve ball I wasn’t expecting… \n\nAfter looking at my MRIs and show me them (first doctor to do so) he explained to me that I am indeed the 5%. He explained that I barely meet the criteria. That my lesions are tiny. He explained that in order to fail a medication you need 4 new lesions and more than 1 in a year. So, if we were to technically say what I’ve been doing is my “medication” it technically hasn’t failed me in a two year time frame of my original onset. He felt hesitant to say whether I needed medication or not because he feared the medication would make my day to day worse than it currently is. He explained that he’s treated over 6,000 patients, he’s watched a long history of family members struggle with bad cases of MS, and he has worked all over the country. We still spoke about what meds he’d recommend but he said, “unless you wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat about not being on meds, KEEP doing whatever you’re doing. Or if you decide one day you just want to eat donuts everyday and you can’t keep doing this, then let’s start meds.”\n\nDamn. \n\nWhat I am doing is a lot of work. It’s exhausting. It’s socially awkward (but I don’t care anymore), and sometimes I’d question if it was all worth it. Blood work is expensive. Constantly retesting to make sure I have the line up of supplements I truly need is expensive. I have learned some things the hard way, and I have also been blessed with major successes. All and all my leaky gut is drastically improving and my brain feels good most days. I am better prepared to nurture and listen to subtle signs my nervous system gives me. \n\nI know everyone’s story is different, and I lost hope for second. I just wanted to say- it’s worth it. Keep protecting and taking care of your body in all facets. Whether that is taking meds or changing lifestyles or all of the above- just keep doing what makes you feel healthy and what feels right for you. This platform has been such a huge inspiration for me and y’all have helped me on the darkest days. \n\nHere’s to letting go of the fear of the future and deeply loving the life we were given 💙",https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/uaargf/the_5/

u9wrgq,1650686273,Going through Diagnosis,"Hi everyone, as of right now I have “suspected MS”. I’m in a really odd position because I have another disorder which prevents blood work from showing antibodies, so most of my blood work is clear EXCEPT FOR a significantly elevated CRP and other inflammatory markers such as elevated T cells and WBC. \n\nCurrently these symptoms come and go and have for a number of years, but the weakness is seeming to have gotten much worse in the last year:\n\nI’m having almost full right side weakness: measurable decrease in right arm strength, despite being right handed, right arm is slower to respond to stimuli, some detectable facial droop on the right side (thankfully I’m told I “compensate” well for this), right eye is slower than the left, my right leg is sometimes just more “sluggish” than the left, this has resulted in me falling on a few occasions.\n\nI also have episodic numb patches, right side of my face was the most startling, but it’s effected certain fingers and spots on my right arm and leg. I also have brisk reflexes in my right knee. \n\nI have a tremor that actually impacts both sides to some degree, but more strongly in my right. It’s worsened when I’m reaching for or holding objects, this has resulted in dropped and tossed silverware and phones. I’ve had this tremor off and on since I was 16 and it’s been my earliest and longest lasting neuro symptom. My latest neurologist called it a “weird” tremor, which I got a laugh from. I’m not sure if it’s related to the tremor, but I’m having muscles spasms and twitching which seem different to me. \n\nRecently I’ve also had urinary urgency and very nearly incontinence, I’ve had VERY near misses recently. I also just feel far less mentally sharp and like it’s hard to tune back in. I’m diagnosed with POTS, so not sure if it’s related, but I also have frequent dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal / chest pains, sometimes feel like my mouth won’t form words. \n\nSo naturally I was quickly shipped off to neurology who was able confirm the weakness and tremor, as well as see the history of the tremor in my notes. Everyone was initially certain I had MS until I had a brain and cervical MRI and everything looks “fine”. I had to wait for an MRI with contrast which I’m supposed to get later this week, but I’m kind of at a loss. \n\nI clearly have systemic inflammation causing neurological symptoms, but it’s not showing in brain and cervical MRIs? Did anyone have an experience like this? I’m going to be seeing all sorts of specialists, but the working theory is still apparently MS, but I don’t feel like this is typical for how people are diagnosed. \n\nAnyone else have an indirect path to diagnosis?

Doing my workout, feeling completly exhausted and don´t know, if it´s MS or my bad condition. Felt down, because I wanted to run but my feet didn´t do, what I want them to do. I feel like I can not trust my body - not knowing if it was MS or clumsioness.  I feel so lost because I don´t want to be a hypochondriac. But i want to take my symptoms serious. If I could only know, what my symptoms are. Any advice, how to learn to trust me and my body again? Another thing: Feeling tired of encourage everyone around me, because they are afraid, what MS could mean to me. My family, my few friends - everyone is scared about my MS, and I need to give them hope that it´s not so bad. I am so tired, I need holidays far away from everything. Did you experience the same after your dignosis? Sorry for this sad post and sorry for my language, I am not native speaking english. Greetings, and thanks for any advice or thoughts about my situation!",https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/u9q2py/i_feel_some_kind_of_beeing_lost/

I also developed an intention tremor in my left hand. I slowly lost sensation from my neck down and developed twitching muscles. I then developed urinary retention and constipation as well as occasional urinary incontinence. I also have weakness in all four limbs.\n\nFrom my understanding these are all suggestive of a progressive myelopathy or spinal cord syndrome. I was certain i had primary progressive MS. I went to see a neurologist who ordered a brain and spine MRI as well as a spinal tap.\n\nMy brain showed two juxtracortical demyelinating lesions which were suspicious for MS. However my spine showed no lesions and spinal tap showed no oligoclonal bands or elevated igG index. My neuro told me I don’t meet the criteria for PPMS.\n\nWhat else could this be but primary progressive ms? Neurosarcodosis? I do have occasional shortness of breath as well as chest and throat pain, strange tastes in my mouth and sometimes smell things that aren’t there. From my understanding these could be due to sarcoidosis? Lyme test was already negative. I’m getting worse month by month.

Perhaps largely due to covid and the paranoia I feel from potentially catching it, I find my memory has worsened and motivation is terrible. Even though I am only a semester away from graduating with a Mechanical Engineering degree, I don't really go to class and require special accommodations for when exams come. I am largely isolated from everyone since I now live on my own and the friends I did have, graduated. It's so difficult to look after myself every day, and I constantly tell myself I'm just lazy and using this as an excuse. I'm currently on Kesimpta, and have been for about a year and a half. There were no active lesions on my last MRI a couple months ago, which is positive. I go on walks everyday and do core exercises to stay somewhat active, yet I still feel bad on many days, especially recently.

I hope this kind of advice is ok -- given how hard it is to get appointments, and how specialized specialists are today, I don't want to waste my or doctors' time.\n\nMy primary symptoms right now are devastating fatigue and brain-fog, with some balance and cognitive issues, for nearly a year. Sort of feels like I'm drunk/hungover all the time, without the fun. Not long covid, negative Lyme and tick-borne disease tests. Given my symptoms that seem more neurologic, especially after normal cardio workup, my cardiologist  kindly ordered an MRI. Report notes I have some mild T2 hyperintensity in the periventricular area ""of doubtful significance"", but my cardiologist suggested I see a neurologist given my symptoms, if only for peace of mind.\n\nThe optic neuritis: never had any brain lesions on MRI at the time or 6 months after. Had mildly abnormal evoked potentials if I recall correctly. Was told to go enjoy my life. \n\nSo, given my main symptoms of fatigue/cognitive/mild balance issues with no episodic numbness or other MS hallmarks, would you recommend I see general neurologist or an MS specialist? I live in an area where there are MS centers and not sure if that is really a route I should go at this time. \n\nFirst office I called said -- you want to see a neurologist for fatigue?

u8hwvc,1650525950,"Battling extreme brain fog for entirety of high school, as well as a need for excessive sleep, and extreme anxiety, Please help!!"," Throughout my life, I have always suffered with anxiety and being ""slow"" in certain social situations.\n\nIn addition, I have a history of childhood ear infections, and the last one in early 7th grade made me permanently deaf in my left ear.\n\nHowever, life was decent enough for me until the latter portion of 8th grade, and that is when the real trouble started.\n\nIt began slowly, but over the first year of high school, I noticed that I would be extremely tired, and unable to get out of bed as before, even after sleeping for 8-9 hours.\n\nBasically, never feeling refreshed after a ""good"" night of sleep.\n\nFor 2 months I was extremely bloated, and couldn't eat much.\n\nI would get music looping in my head, driving me crazy. These were popular songs which I enjoyed.\n\nOver the period of this year, a severe brain fog began to develop, and I began to struggle in classes.\n\nI couldn't do simple homework assignments in areas which I had previously excelled in, it was just too taxing for my brain.\n\nMy anxiety skyrocketed to levels never seen before, talking to even my friends became impossible, my face would turn beet red when called on in class, even in subjects which I enjoyed.\n\nMy gaze and awareness were also affected, I would not be able to look normally at peoples faces as I was able to before. My eyes would abnormally fixate on their eyes, and I could see how weird it made them feel, they would avoid eye contact with me.\n\nI guess this would be considered ""hyperawareness.""\n\nIn addition, I felt very depersonalized, like a shell.\n\nAfter orgasm, I felt even more fatigued then usual, and the brain fog and anxiety, already horrible, became worse.\n\nI should have told my parents right then, but I didn't, and my struggles continued throughout all of high school.\n\nI stayed home and took online classes my first year of college, as my parents did not trust me to succeed alone at college.\n\nHere, I was able to sleep in for the first time in my life.\n\nDuring this year, I was getting around 10 -12 hours of sleep everyday.\n\nSlowly, the brain fog began to fade, as did the post-orgasm symptoms, and the anxiety began to lessen, as did the looping music, and my grades became straight A's, as opposed to the C's in high school.\n\nThe next year, (2019), I went to live on my own in college, and took in person classes.\n\nThis resulted in my averaging about 7-8 hours of sleep per night, and behold, the symptoms all came back. My grades dipped, and I am at home as I type this.\n\nAdditionally, over the past year, I have developed a blinking tic, and when I become tired, my left eye will shrink, and left side of my face becomes droopy. \n\nCould this be some kind of due to brain damage from the ear infection? Multiple Sclerosis? \n\nI also seem to have a gluten sensitivity- my stomach becomes very bloated and anxiety seems to get a bit worse.\n\nI have gotten some blood tests done, seem to be normal, however, my liver is severely damaged, judging by the high level of liver enzymes.\n\nI eat extremely heathy, minimal sugar/junk.\n\nMy sleep seems to be normal to my knowledge, I am very skinny, and lightly snore, so don't meet the sleep apnea stereotype. I have also used an o2 smartwatch, which did not show any significant o2 desaturation. But I need 11-12 hours of sleep to feel refreshed, which is not at all normal. \n\nUars maybe? But even that doesn't explain the severity of the symptoms.\n\nThis is all so weird, and I have not found anyone on the net with these kinds of symptoms or their level of extremity. Why does sleeping 11+ hours drastically reduce the severity of my symptoms?\n\nFor the past 6 - 7 I have lost out on my life, and no idea what it is to live a normal life.\n\nCan someone please give me some ideas or steer me in the right direction??\n\nAny help would really be appreciated.\n\nThank you all so much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/u8hwvc/battling_extreme_brain_fog_for_entirety_of_high/

Before the mavenclad there was barely noticeable weakness. Through the course of mavenclad ( I just finished year 2) it’s become a lot more noticeable. If I walk over 30 minutes my legs starts to feel weak and floppy. When I do strength training there’s a huge difference in with my right side shaky and wobbly way before my left. I didn’t have a relapse to explain it. To me it really seems to be related to the drug. The weird thing is in some ways I feel like it’s helped like all my weird buzzy ms stuff has quieted way down. It’s just so weird I don’t get it. I continue to hope and pray that maybe it’s one of those gets worse before it gets better things. On the mavenclad Facebook group a few others have noted that.

u84xrg,1650484425,"HUGE: Atara Bio Planning Phase 3 Trials of ATA188 in Non-active SPMS, PPMS","**Atara Biotherapeutics plans to launch two Phase 3 clinical trials of its investigational immunotherapy ATA188 in people with non-active, progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS).**\n\nWhether efforts for these trials will go forward, however, depends on positive results from an interim analysis of the Phase 2 portion of the EMBOLD trial (NCT03283826), expected in the coming months. Interim findings will also inform the optimal size needed for EMBOLD — currently enrolling progressive MS patients at U.S. and Australian sites — to meet its goals.\n\nAtara’s plans for ATA188, along with results from EMBOLD’s Phase 1 part, were detailed in a company investor presentation.\n\nMostly known for causing infectious mononucleosis, or mono, EBV infects about 95% of the adult population at some point in life. After infection — which can go unnoticed by most people — the virus lingers in the body in a dormant form inside B-cells, a type of immune cell involved in the abnormal immune attacks that drive neurodegeneration in MS.\n\nNotably, compelling evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship between EBV and MS was provided early this year in a study that analyzed more than two decades of data covering over 10 million U.S. military members.\n\nInfection with EBV, but not other viruses, was found to both precede and be necessary for MS development, increasing the risk of the disease by 32 times — the strongest link yet.\n\n**A separate study, published just weeks later, showed that this link may be due to structural similarities between an EBV protein and certain brain proteins. While fighting off the virus, antibodies produced by B-cells against EBV may accidentally bind to these proteins in the brain, triggering immune attacks that damage nerve cells.**\n\n*Infused directly into the bloodstream, ATA188 is made of T-cells — immune cells with the ability to fight infections and other threats — modified to target and kill EBV-infected B-cells. To be more scalable and efficient, the therapy uses T-cells collected from healthy donors instead of the patients themselves.*\n\n**ATA188 received fast track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a potential treatment of both non-active primary and secondary progressive MS (PPMS and SPMS). This designation is expected to speed the therapy’s clinical development and regulatory review.**\n\nThe two-part, Phase 1/2 EMBOLD trial is evaluating ATA188’s safety and effectiveness in adults with non-active PPMS and SPMS. Of note, there is currently no approved treatment for people with non-active SPMS.\n\nIn its Phase 1 part, 24 patients were given one of four escalating doses of ATA188 and followed for one year to determine the best dose for further testing in the study’s placebo-controlled Phase 2 part.\n\nAmong those completing the one-year assessment, 18 chose to enroll in its open-label extension (OLE) phase, in which they are receiving one ATA188 infusion every year for up to four years.\n\nPreviously reported results showed a dose-response effect for ATA188, with patients given the two highest doses (20 and 40 million T-cells) being more likely to achieve clinical improvements at one year.\n\nNotably, these improvements were associated with a significant increase in magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) — an MRI biomarker considered to reflect myelin density — indicating fewer lesions and potential remyelination, or myelin repair.\n\nNewly presented data, concerning up to 3.5 years of follow-up, indicated that 20 (83.3%) of the 24 patients experienced a sustained stabilization (13 patients) or improvement (seven patients) meaning a lessening in their functional disability, as assessed with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).\n\nSome of these improvements reflected the return of previously lost functions, such as the ability to walk unaided or for longer distances, suggesting a reversal of disease progression, Atara reported.\n\nThe therapy was found to be generally safe and well-tolerated across all doses.\n\nUp to 80 PPMS and SPMS patients with evidence of past or current EBV infection are currently being enrolled in EMBOLD’s Phase 2 part. They will be randomly assigned to two cycles of either the optimal dose of ATA188 or a placebo.\n\nAfter one year of follow-up, patients in the placebo group will receive two cycles of ATA188, while those originally assigned to the therapy will be given one cycle of the therapy and one cycle of placebo, according to the trial’s NCT document.\n\nAfter these two years, Phase 2 participants may choose to enroll in an open-label extension study, and be treated once a year for up to three years.\n\nAtara now plans to conduct a formal interim analysis of both safety and efficacy data, with the main goal being reductions in the EDSS scores, indicating less disability, at six months. The company noted Phase 1 trial data suggested that EDSS reductions at six months strongly predict sustained improvements at one year.\n\nOther efficacy measures and biomarkers, such as MTR, will also be analyzed.\n\nCheck the article for more info here: [Article Link](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2022/04/19/phase-3-trials-ata188-non-active-spms-ppms-planned-atara/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/u84xrg/huge_atara_bio_planning_phase_3_trials_of_ata188/

u84sxm,1650484062,My friends cut me off because of MS mood swings/mental health. Is this normal?,"Hello my MS friends,\n\nI'm a 28 year old male who was diagnosed with Primary Progressive MS about 7-8 months ago. I'm still reeling from the diagnosis and even the tiny bit of degeneration I've experienced has made me incredibly anxious and fearful. I've also struggled with BPD and depression for a long time. This Easter the two culminated in such a way that people I considered my friends cut me off during an acute mental health crisis.\n\nA little background: When the pandemic began, a group of my real life friends and I moved our monthy D&amp;D game to Discord as we couldn't meet up in person. After a while we all became accustomed to playing online and before long I was running our game weekly. And using it as a means of escaping from the troubles of the world and as something to give myself a sense or stability and normalcy. I poured my heart and soul into this, spending upwards of 20 hours a week creating material and preparing plotlines and scenarios. I didn't mind to do it as it provided an outlet for my creativity and my friends loved my storytelling and were all having fun.\n\nThen my MS diagnosis came. I've spent the last couple of years learning to manage my BPD, but the shock of being diagnosed with such a terrible, progressive disease wrecked me. My mind was suddenly filled with grief and fear. The mindfulness techniques I had learned to manage my BPD were all but forgotten. And so, one thing that has happened as a result of this is I've become very, VERY touchy about my time and whenever I think people are wasting it. Knowing that it's limited now in a very real sense has made me value everything I do. And suddenly, those 20+ hours of prep work I do became something that I cared perhaps irrationally strongly about. I didn't mind people missing our games if they gave me a couple of days notice and had a valid reason. But dropping out 20 minutes before we're meant to begin because you forgot you had to work today and didn't think to tell me? No, I'll call you out on that and expect an apology.\n\nSo, we get to Easter. Last weekend. I'm all set up, ready to go and I've just finished preparing 90+ maps and a 40,000 word document for our latest campaign. Something I've been working on since December. And suddenly one of my players told me she can't play because she had found out earlier in the week that her cousin is dying. She's understandably upset. This girl is on the autism spectrum, she's definitely not neurotypical also suffers from a chronic illness (not MS). So, regrettably, due to being in a bad place myself, I went off at her for wasting my time and how valuable it is. Later that day, I recognised how saying that to someone whose family member is dying is completely insensitive, so I privately messaged her apologising for sounding insensitive, registering my concern for her and once again explaining why I feel the way I currently do due to my current frame of mind. In the past, this girl has sent quite a few insensitive things about my MS or attacked me over minor things because of it, and later apologised and asked me to cut her some slack due to her own problems. So I thought this wouldn't be an issue.\n\nThe next day, I woke up to a public message in my group chat where all my friends could see it saying that I had crossed the line by attacking her, that her cousin and her grief were more important than my time, and that she was leaving. She waited for the moment I appeared as online to post this, knowing that I would see it. And then left before I could respond to it. I melted down. I told my friends I felt betrayed and attacked and that all I wanted was for my time to be taken seriously. My other friend, who is this girl's boyfriend, insisted that I had crossed the line and that I had no reason to feel attacked. I should have probably accepted that then and there. But this also coincided with me receiving news that my MS had already attacked my brain and that I may have a speech impediment with the next 5 years (I got the phone call from the doctor literally that day). So I demanded that this girl be held accountable for all the nasty things she has said in the past and that I should be shown the same courtesy of my friends cutting me some slack because I've had a big shock. My ""friend"" insisted his girlfriend had done nothing wrong and that she never said insensitive things. My BPD combined with the shock I'm still apparently trying to process from my MS took over, and I sent a series of messages trying to explain why I thought my feelings were valid and that I just wanted people to acknowledge that I am processing something terrible that is happening to me. I got a message back saying ""You are delusional. Do not contact me on any platform again"" and was blocked. Thus ends a nearly 3 year friendship with two people that I really cared about.\n\nMy other friend, the last remaining member of our group, told me that ""both sides were wrong"" and stated that he was overwhelmed so he wanted to ""take a break from me"". He hasn't spoken a single word to me in 2 days now. He has remained friends with the other two and hasn't even taken the courtesy of calling them out on anything. He offered no words of sympathy or any attempt to acknowledge that anything I felt was valid. Nobody even said anything in response to me telling them my latest results. My friend said he had been ""looking up MS"" because he was sure it didn't ""make people act crazy"".\n\nSo here I am. Two meaningful relationships down the drain thanks to a crisis and non-sick people having no idea how to support someone going through an episode other than declaring them crazy. I just feel so raw and meaningless after what was from my perspective a cruel and unnecessary betrayal at one of my lowest moments. I hate this disease so much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/u84sxm/my_friends_cut_me_off_because_of_ms_mood/

u7joge,1650414248,MS or MS-like symptoms only taken seriously after injury,"35F, severe nerve damage from the knees down and in right arm. Migraines, cognitive issues, constant neuro pain\n\nApologies if this isn't allowed, no diagnosis yet but have had suspicions based on symptoms/testing. I've had issues since I was 16, but only started taking off in my very early 30s. I have seen more neurologists than I would like to admit for extreme nerve pain/burning/ and loss of sensation in my lower limbs, balance issued and cognitive problems (my head constantly feels fuzzy). It's been half a decade since it's started and I only just got a nerve study last summer, despite being told I don't have any damage. Report says very different. Neuro looks at my B levels and iron levels and says I'm normal. \n\nI've gotten a lot more clumsy since then. I drop things. I have a hard time with my hands some days, where typing can be difficult (I do a lot of admin office work) or I struggle to hold things like chopsticks. I trip a lot, but I usually catch myself – or I make sure I have a death grip on a railing or something secure so I don't accidentally bite it.\n\nBut I recently had a bad fall. Fell down a full flight of stairs and ended up with a concussion. Scared the **** out of me. I made an appointment with my old neuro (the one who told me nothing was wrong) only to have to reschedule with someone new. The moment he heard I fell, he did a full exam, the first time I've had one in a very long time. I've got a full panel of labs, including retesting ANA (it's been consistently positive but negative titers). If that comes back negative then we're looking at a lumbar puncture and possibly genetic testing. \n\nI've been asking to be seen for half a decade. Pleading. I advocated for patients going through this same thing, and I understand now why some of them just gave up for a while. I don't know if this is what it is, all of the signs and symptoms keep pointing back to it but I'm so afraid that I'm just trying to fit whatever is wrong with this stupid body into a box I know. \n\nSorry, again. I don't have a diagnosis. I don't know if this is it.

u6qi1k,1650323976,Question about Solu-Medrol infusion,"Hi everyone, \n\nPlease excuse me if this type of question isn’t typical, but I’m not sure where else to turn; my wife was “diagnosed” last week after several rounds of imaging and blood work (I say “diagnosed” because we still have yet to see neurology and her primary doctor is “treating as MS” versus actually diagnosing it). \n\nAnyway, she was given a 3-day/1,000mg p/day infusion of Solu-Medrol (without taper) beginning Friday of last week, with the last infusion yesterday. This all began two weeks ago today when she developed paresthesias on her entire right side - face, arm, side, leg, with weakness in her right hand grip. \n\nAfter the first infusion on Friday night, she noticed that the numbness/weakness had subsided, which I was able to confirm by tickling her right foot - she’s always had extremely ticklish feet and for the last two weeks she’s had no feeling in that foot. So that was good, but then began the wave of side effects after the subsequent infusions on Saturday and Sunday (side effects which are well documented on this sub - thanks and sorry to everyone who has had to deal with them). She did the last infusion yesterday morning and basically felt crappy all through yesterday and still today. \n\nHowever, along with the expected side effects, as of earlier today her numbness/weakness on her right side has returned - no longer ticklish on the right foot, feeling weakness in her hand, heaviness on that side of her face - basically back to where she was before the infusions (with the added “bonus” of side effects from the steroids). Needless to say, she’s really upset and concerned that the treatment isn’t working and feeling quite defeated after the whirlwind of the last two weeks since this all started. \n\nI am posting this in hopes of finding out if a relapse of symptoms is normal the day after stopping the infusions due to withdrawals or something of that sort; I left a message for her doctor already, but I’m concerned she might not even have a great answer since she is not a neurologist. Any insight or advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance 🙏",https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/u6qi1k/question_about_solumedrol_infusion/

I don't go too the docs for MS because I'm not sure I want them throwing me in MS mess when I've made it this many years and do just fine.\n\nWhat I really want to ask is to see if there are advancements now to repair the damage from the optic neuritis.  My right eye was the one that seemed to be affected.  It tears more easily too during the day.  The right side of my brain/head also feels discomforted with pains a fair amount of the time but not always.  Laying down definitely helps and stress does not.\n\nHere in 2022 yr are there ways that we have now to make better the damage??? I think whatever this damage is is also responsible for making me tired a large percentage of the time because it makes the brain work harder or something.  My left eye and left side of my head seems fine.  I saw a lot of docs just to make sure they all had the same view and noone had anything new to say.\n\nMaybe I am looking for clinical trials or something???
