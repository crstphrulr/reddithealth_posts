(I apologise i cant remember all of the tests and drugs as it was a bit of a stressful time). At the time my problems were really just very bad pain in the stomach. In the end I found that a lot of gluten seemed to make me need the toilet badly so stopped consuming it and started taking imipramine. Which seemed to slightly lessen my pain however started to cause bad constipation(needing but not managing to go). I decided that that the slight decrease in pain wasn't worth the constipation trouble. So stopped taking it which stopped the constipation. Over time the pain lessened to an extent where it was not really a problem at all.  \n\n**My Current Problems**\n\nRecently during a particularly stressful time i started to redevelop my constipation but just attributed it to the stress. After the time was over my problem started to lessen. But not entirely. I started to take Bisacodyl again as i was before. However this time i was not particularly needing, just not going for days on end which was really getting to me. I upped my water and fruit/veg intake which seems to have had no effect.

How would I go about finding a good therapist/counsellor?\n\nI have diagnosed IBS-D and as much as I hate to admit it, I’m struggling mentally. \n\nI’ve reached out to two or three different GPs about my IBS at this point and I’ve done all of their recommendations: 6 sessions of CBT (the max the NHS offers at once), peppermint capsules, peppermint tea, breathing exercises/meditation, low FODMAP diet to cut out food triggers, taking Buscopan almost daily, and taking Imodium at least twice a week when needed. The latter two medications are what have helped me get through my office job but I’m terrified of building up a tolerance to them and being left with nothing to control my diarrhoea at work.\n\nIt’s all draining me mentally. I literally never see my friends anymore because every time I did I’d have a flare up. Sometimes I sit in work meetings and almost black out from my anxiety around potential IBS flare ups. \n\nI think I desperately need mental health support. The dietician I recently saw in March (for PCOS reasons, not IBS) also realised the situation I was in and said she would refer me for counselling but I’ve not heard anything since and don’t expect to hear anything for a good few months as I know NHS waiting lists are long.\n\nI have some private healthcare through my work with the healthcare provider Bupa but I have no idea how to even get started with finding my own therapist or counsellor.\n\nWhat would you do in this situation?

I've had some trouble sleeping during this period and this occurs only during the wee hours of the morning while i'm still awake (\~4:00 am onwards). The thing is, as long as i get enough sleep, the feeling tends to go away when i wake up.\n\nDoctor doesn't know what's the problem (basing off the tests mentioned above) and since it abates after rest and don't really occur when i sleep at more sane hours, they're thinking it's likely just IBS acting up during this time.\n\nOh, and the past few months, a bruise has appeared in the area. Not sure if it's related, hopefully just a coincidence.\n\nThanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/udf4oh/sensations_around_my_lower_abdominal_area_during/

udds9u,1651093248,Bloated but not constipated and it's more than gas.,"Admittedly I don't have the 411 on IBS nor am I diagnosed. But these past 3 and a half weeks have been hell and it's been suggested numerous times now that I may have it, and the earliest appointment I could get with a GI specialist is July 25. \n\nAnyways, this started when I noticed I was extremely bloated for weeks on end. I work out regularly and usually eat a variety of whole foods throughout the week, and naturally tend towards a low fat diet with lean meats. Admittedly I don't eat a lot of fruits and veggies but I have satisfying ghost poops about every other day.   \n\nOn weekends, I generally to go out with friends, end up eating a large amount of outside food (restaurant or fast food). As expected, I bloat up with excess water weight, but within 3 days of eating my regular diet things go back to normal. \n\nOne particular week, I had outside food twice in the weekend then during the week, so I knew I wouldn't have a chance to see my body in it's normal state for a time. The next week I also went out with friends but I figured things would just go back to normal once I had a whole week to myself. They didn't. \n\nI also ate a lot of cereal during this time, which has caused stomach upset in the past. But I hadn't had cereal in years and loved it in the past so I wanted to indulge. And I ate lactose about twice during this time, once with a lactose pill and once without.\n\nIn other words, there are multiple factors that may have led to my current state. I had been pooping normally the whole time but I think at some point things just got backed up. And the past 10 days have been a flurry of laxatives, one ER visit, and then yesterday I downed a whole bottle of Miralax and was pooping yellow/clear water at the end of it--which normally would be a sign that I've cleared my bowels. \n\nI'm not as excessively bloated as I once was. However, I'm still far more bloated than my normal state. And I know it's not gas because I am still several pounds heavier than usual, in spite of not eating enough to put on multiple pounds of fat. \n\nWhat could be the cause of this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/udds9u/bloated_but_not_constipated_and_its_more_than_gas/

udcp6a,1651090411,Miralax and peeing a lot?,"So I've had IBS-C literally since I was a child. I am 23 now. The only thing that has ever worked has been taking miralax every single morning. I know it isn't ideal and you really shouldn't take laxatives regulary but even prescriptions like Amitiza weren't working and this is the only thing that has kept me able to go regularly. I very rarely (like less than once a month) get diarrhea from it, but almost every time I take it I get extreme nausea and I have to pee like a racehorse for the next 4-5 hours, even if I don't drink anything except the dosed water. Drinking it on and off throughout a few hours helps the nausea some, but it can screw with the regularity of my BMs. I often feel like I've drank too much water after taking it, and I am just worried that that feeling in combination with several rounds of clear urine means I am over-hydrating. I feel very sluggish after as well.   \nI was just wondering if anyone else had experienced this with taking Miralax every day?   \nI typically only take half to 3/4 of a dose in 12oz of water (because the taste is gross lol) but I do take it every morning. It usually produces a BM every other morning about an hour after I take it.  \nI really need to figure this out because in a little over a year I'll be teaching full time, and I can't go to school feeling like this every single day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/udcp6a/miralax_and_peeing_a_lot/
udchgx,1651089859,IBS- urgent advice needed,"I was “diagnosed” with IBS at around 12, after visiting the doctors showing symptoms for coeliac disease. For a while, it was fine — flare-ups only occasionally, every two weeks or so (if only that could be the case now!) — but has recently become much worse after I have started my first year at uni. I’ve learnt that there are different kinds of bouts for diarrhoea — the average, daily kind, and the sweat-until-you-feel-like-dying, abominable pain kind— and more recently, the latter has been the one I’ve experienced the most often. I went to see my GP, as I was having difficulty eating most things without being ill, and, as I’m sure you know, it’s had a massive impact on my social life and mental health. They recommended anti-anxiety medication to treat everything (which they said might make it worse). At the moment, it appears quite hopeless, and it is having a severe effect on almost everything I do. Is there anything beyond the obvious — Imodium, brat diet, low fodmaps, gluten free (I’ve tried it all) — that you’ve used which has helped? Or any diagnoses to perhaps bring up at a future appointment? \nAnything (literally anything) will be much appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/udchgx/ibs_urgent_advice_needed/

ud8t11,1651080046,Diarrhea everyday only after lunch,"Hi all, I’ve struggled with IBS since I was a teenager. 29 now. It has always seemed like stress, worry, and anxiety were the biggest triggers for me, not really food (except for a lot of sugar and I do have a huge sweet tooth). \n\nFor the last 6-7 years, things have been great. Only very occasionally have I had the whole cramps/relentless diarrhea/day- or night-ruining episode. \n\nHowever, I’ve instead struggles immensely with the onset of migraine. I tend to get mostly nausea snd vomiting with migraine, but rarely diarrhea.\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago I started noticing that almost everyday, *only* after eating lunch, I would have a diarrhea episode. Breakfast and dinner seem completely fine. There’s no pattern to what I’m eating. I tend to eat all kinds of things. I have been extremely stressed due to a specific event, but it’s over now and things have been improving a lot and are only going to improve. Meaning, I should be (and genuinely do feel) over the stressful episode.\n\nWhy is this happening to me?

ud8sxg,1651080039,3/13/21 repost,"2 1/2 years, worst than ever\n\nAlright this is gonna be a long one where I’m gonna go in depth about what’s help me and what hasn’t. I got diagnosed right when I turned 17. I never had any health complications before that except for really bad stomach aches which happened every so often and would land me in the hospital hunched over wanting to die for hours. This made living life and having a high school career in technical theater very difficult. I once had to be pulled out of school and taken to the hospital on opening night. Thank god they gave me Benadryl which made me pass out and I was able to make it just a little bit after curtain call. That was the first time I was scared and had no idea what was wrong with me because I knew it was getting worse and more frequent. This was during may of 2018.\n\nI spent the whole summer trying to figure out what was triggering my stomach. Was it stress like every doctor had me believing? Or was it something worse? Blood test came back normal every time, urine and stole too. By this time I went to New York and my health acted up again. Okay maybe this is stress and I wish that was the worst of it. But by the time my 17th birthday which is in October came around I was having stomach pains every other day, had to miss homecoming and was very suicidal. \n\nAnd overnight my life went from a living nightmare to worse. I just woke up one morning feeling like my insides were rotting, and that feeling never went away. Days turned into weeks and weeks into months. I was a 4.0 student who was forced to drop out during Christmas break because of how severe this had gotten. I was so drained and hurting that I literally couldn’t battle the fatigue anymore along with 8 different classes. \n\nThat was the worst chapter of my life because it felt like I was worse off than dead and that’s where my mental health completely went haywire. I got dumped for being sick, I was told by her suicide was my best bet and even now I think that sadistic scum bag was right. \n\nAnyway spring of 2019 was just doctor after doctor. And none of them even made a real attempt to help me understand my body. Doctors at insta care acted like I was wasting there time, nurses acted like I was stupid and shut me down on any theory, question or test. All I got was “it’s stress, inherited illness or ibs- the go to when doctors are sick of you complaining. “... there’s nothing we can do but here’s some more anti depressants and opioids.”\n\nI was put on many different anti depressants but the only one that helped my mood and didn’t make me worse off was escitalopram 10 mg. By that time I was able to cope and was slowly improving but that rotting gut and bloated feeling was always there. This made working for my dad almost impossible during the summer. I was miserable but I did my best to down play it. Thank god I discovered peppermint pills are life savers for gas attacks.\n\nI learned to manage my stress or I call it numbing out. I managed to return to school that fall, even though it was only for half days and I was half a year behind now, I managed to get back onto stage crew and I loved every minute of it but after I graduated I just crashed. Being on the toilet every morning just to drag myself through 3 hours of school everyday was absolutely hell but as the day continues my symptoms would become more bare able and I’d feel somewhat better. But the truth is the boy I was was long dead and he wasn’t coming back. I was addicted to painkillers just to get through day to day. My ex was ruining my life and harassing me on a daily basis and my relationship with my family was in shambles because I hid this illness from my brothers for so long. They thought I was a lazy burn out and was making all this up.\n\nDuring my senior year I went to every doctor imaginable to try and find some answers and it really felt like a run around. One doctor would say it’s candida overgrowth so I’d go on a diet and take supplements. The bills were running up and I had little to no relief. I even got a colonoscopy on my 18th birthday and had to go to school like nothing had happened. Btw colonoscopy came back normal so that lead my GI specialist to come up with the same conclusion as the “holistic” doctor but I quit the supplements after 6 months of ZERO improvement. In fact I felt worse and I was being told to increase using these supplements and I’d be healthy by spring. \n\nWell after that I gave up on doctors, everyone saying they can heal me without actually talking through it with me. Or let alone explain to me what the hell was making my body be this way or have trouble digesting proteins. I was just another paycheck for them. \n\nBefore I continue here’s a list of the supplements: Standard process Zypan, zymex, black radish, (with every meal) along with garlic forte, gb plus and so many other dietary supplements. Nothing helped. Maybe the garlic forte but everything else made my stomach feel more raw and bloated. If it wasn’t for covid, I wouldn’t have made it through to my last show or even graduated because my health was now just as bad as when I first got this. \n\nNow it’s been a whole year of being a hermit. I have two friends and I don’t let them know how bad my health is, they too probably just think I’m a lazy dead beat. I can’t work while my brother is making 40,000 a year doing carpentry jobs with my dad. All I want is to work a 9-5 or even go to college and I can’t. I’m tired of living this way and I know if I can’t fundamentally change my body and mind, I’ll end up falling through and that scares me everyday. I just want some sense of normality again. \n\nI’m also scared of trying more probiotics because I feel like that’s what couldve started all this. I started taking dr. Formulated probiotics for men (one a day) about a month before my gut went full haywire to help manage stress and balance out my hormone levels. \n\nSo now I’m reaching out to other sufferers, do you and I have the same problems? What has helped? What hasn’t? Am I to live with this disability or are there actually answers? How do I find the motivation or even will to continue searching for wellness when it’s farther out of grasp than ever? \n\nI am going to go back on a low fodmap diet again because I did have one relatively better month during senior year when I was eating just almond butter and rice cakes. But I tired including yogurt as a test after a few weeks and it was like all that progress got reversed and I just gave up. Fell hard into depression and been dealing with more insensitive BPDD than I ever had growing up. \n\nI’m 19 now turning 20 in October. Nov. 6 will mark 3 years. I’m tired of falling farther behind my peers, I’m tired of living in pain, I miss what it’s like to feel euphoric. I snowboard but there’s just no joy in it anymore when my body’s health is so uncertain.

ucwl43,1651038923,IBS Help,"\n\nIBS is a chronic debilitating condition that affects millions of people.  As many have mentioned, it has a significant impact on an individuals quality of life and is disruptive to social life and work environments.  \n\nThe pathology of IBS is likely multifactorial.  We don’t know entirely what the root cause of IBS is.  We suspect that infections in the gut can spur on the symptoms.  We also believe that the bacterial environment in the gut can become out of balance, or something called bacterial dysbiosis.  We also know that dietary intolerance exacerbates the symptoms.  More recently we have come to find that there is overlap between IBS and dyspepsia (pressure, pain, and bloating) that often occurs following meals.  In addition, there appears to be chronic, low level inflammation within the gut.\n\nThis combination of symptoms can spur on chronic pain.  Our brain is like a muscle and portions of the brain that signal pain build in relation to pain symptoms much like our muscles build with exercise and thus the pain can be progressive and worse as time goes on.  \n\nNatural treatments appear to be as affective as many pharmaceuticals.  A diet low in FODMAPS,  is frequently recommended to help alleviate symptoms. \n\nHowever, there are other therapies that have been studied in clinical trials that can be quite helpful TOO! \n\nPeppermint oil and caraway oil have been show to improve symptoms of IBS, however, combined pills can be quite costly.\n\nButyric acid is a post-biotic that is generated by the breakdown of fiber in the diet.  Many patients with IBS lack the bacteria needed to turn this fiber into butyric acid.  Butyric acid is, in turn, is the primary energy source to the cells lining the gut.  By providing cells with the energy source of butyric acid, the weak connections can heal , potentially reduce inflammation within the gut and help to improve the symptoms of IBS. \n\nThere are a number of supplements that claim to improve IBS.  A new supplement called IBHALT has entered the market and contains the constituents of caraway oil and peppermint oil to help change the bacterial environment in the gut as well as reduce the pain signals that largely contribute to the symptoms of IBS.  \n\nIn addition,  IBHALT contains butyric acid, in the form of Tributyrin, which can help to heal the lining of the gut, much like that which has been seen in other forms of inflammation within the gut.  \n\nI would encourage individuals with IBS to try this formulation to see if it could help them.  I have seen great responses with this already.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/ucwl43/ibs_help/

My symptoms have been worse for the past few weeks, alternating between very hard lumps and flaky diarrhea. I took 2 Colace on Sunday night and GasX yesterday but I don’t think either of them helped.

I know people recommend warm prune juice but it didn’t work for me last time so I didn’t bother trying it. \n\nAfter dinner I started to get desperate and did a saline fleet enema. I didn’t get a strong urge so I just started to push a bit.

Left to my own devices. \n\nI am now 34 (female) &amp; I think I’m having a hard time differentiating between my IBS &amp; my anxiety. Or if they can actually BE separated. When I am anxious, my stomach goes on a rampage. Which makes me more anxious, sometimes leading to a panic attack. When my stomach is uncooperative, I am in a full blown panic attack. \n\nI guess it’s a “what came first, the chicken or the egg?” Is my anxiety irritating my IBS, is my IBS causing panic attacks, or both? \n\nAm I the only grown adult that has panic attacks over having bowel movements?

uccthf,1650980409,"Is it IBS? After consulting doctor Google, it’s sparked my interest. Thoughts?","Not sure if I have IBS, after googling it sparked my interest.\n\nI go into pretty extreme detail here, just for your warning. \n\nSo, for as long as I can remember I have always dealt with constipation. I was born with spina bifida which can affect issues with both your bladder and bowels. \n\nBack in 2019 my kidneys failed as a later complication to Spina Bifida and I started on dialysis treatments. Ever since then, I can honestly say my bowels and stomach has given nothing but grief. I’m a male, I’ve never really thought much into it and just learnt to live with my symptoms. \n\nKeep in mind these symptoms have been “active” since 2019. They include: \n\n-obvious constipation that requires daily laxative use to have any sort of bowel movement\n-feeling as if I am not getting everything out after the laxatives have essentially worked. I will go back to sleep and my stomach essentially relaxes from feeling so tight (will touch more on this) and then what I was feeling like I still had to pass comes out in massive amount of liquid form. \n- after my initial bowel movements I always feel like my lower abdomen/colon is contracting and I always feel the urge to go back and have a bowel movement, which results in nothing. \n- after I feel “better” for a couple of hours is when it starts all over again but it often involves massive amounts of pain in my abdomen and nothing really eases it, I’ve literally been in my pain for up to 5 hours with Panadol being taken and hot water bottles applied. Eventually I start passing lots and lots of gas but also what seems like this clear liquid to be coming out. Never had anything like that, this “symptom” has been present for only about 12 months tops. At first I didn’t think much of it and just thought it was normal gas, but to have clear liquid coming out too? Not so sure. \n\n\nSo guys, that’s basically my life story. Do you reckon I could be living with IBS? I know it’s not fully diagnosable until a colonoscopy is performed, but I just want some opinions. \n\nCheers!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/uccthf/is_it_ibs_after_consulting_doctor_google_its/

Years ago I landed in the ER with what I thought was an infection - I felt run down, in pain, only to be told I was backed up. I asked them how that was possible I’ve been having bowel movements the doc said you can be constipated with bowel movements. We had a laugh cuz my issue was literally I was filled with shit. \n\nMost recently I’ve been having a LOT of pain in my lower abdomen, it felt like belly button pain and migrated to the bottom of my belly. It’s been over a week, I feel terrible. I’m freaking out. My stool is slightly thin, no blood, just pain. I have rectal pain before I pass gas or have a bowel movement. I’m so scared it’s the dreaded C word.\n\nThis is somewhat off-topic but I had gone to the eye doc where some freckle was found and upon going to the retinal specialist I was told my freckles are “bear tracked” which coincides with a very rare disease called FAP which means you are guaranteed to have colon cancer. It so happened her husband was a GI and pushed me to go to him. This obviously took away all her credibility and went to seek out another opinion where I was told that these freckles are most definitely\nnot bear tracked since I have two of them in my retina, and probably not even freckles at all but rather scarring from an infection I may of had as a child. But now that I’m having this pain my brain is doing the what if game and I am terrified. \n\nObviously this is making my symptoms worse. Has anything gone down this road and what has helped? \n\nJust venting and looking for support. I know we aren’t doctors but in the same shitty boat.

ub3ulc,1650833013,Motegrity and bloating.,I’ve been using linzess for years for my constipation and it’s been fine but I hate that I have to wait 30 min to eat or drink anything and it usually gives me one movement and I’m done for the day.

The first time I lost 30 pounds in 6 weeks, another 10 in the months since but I was finally able to eat tiny meals frequently so I was at least getting nutrition and enough calories.\n\nTHEN - I really thought I was past this and then all of a sudden last weekend it hit again. I've lost 5 pounds in a week and still haven't gotten past a mouthful of boost or a 1/2 broth. \n\nMy question is, those with this type - does this happen every flare up? Is there anything you can recommend calorie wise that's not anything solid or heavy?  If this is the norm, do doctors have anything to supplement or what happens? I have about 20 pounds left before I'm officially unhealthy, trying to figure out my life before it gets to that point.\n\nThis is definitely not a problem I ever thought I'd have, I've always been a bit heavier so I'm glad I at least started with extra so it's only becoming concerning now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/ub3fmw/massive_weight_loss_is_this_my_life_now/

I was eating a lot of fats and protein and not working out much prior to March.   \nWas on Pantoprazole 40mg PPI for the whole month, blood tests came back fine and the H.pylori test came back negative. Even did a UTI test and ultrasound for KUB, which the doctor assured me looks fine.   \n\n\nThen, did a fecal calprotectin, which registered at 1140 ug/g.

uan7cx,1650776382,Flare up or stomach bug?,"IBS is still somewhat new to me, but for the past two days I’ve been having abdominal cramping that gets worse when I eat. I had a home made soup today and that usually doesn’t cause a flare up, but today after I ate soup the cramping was so bad and it came with gas. I have also experienced some nausea and loss of appetite. How do I know If this is just a really long flare up or if I have some sort of stomach bug? Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/uan7cx/flare_up_or_stomach_bug/

uallf7,1650770272,Question concerning dietary fiber,"So I’ve been dealing with gut issues for years now, pelvic floor dysfunction causes me constipation issues.\nSo i eat the same food everyday for lunch an breakfast— I use the same amount of dietary fiber for my breakfast as I do my lunch.. and eat the same amount of the same thing.. except I noticed lately ive been constipated all evening and some evenings I don’t poop my lunch and go to bed hurting.. could I be using too much dietary fiber? My lunch/breakfast meal consists of 2/3lb of ground beef and a stock of lettuce.. I consume it with a little less than a 1/2 tsp of psyllium husk. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong to be totally clogged after dinner any words from you guys would help I just am wondering if I should cut back on the dietary fiber after lunch and wait till the evenings to redose…",https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/uallf7/question_concerning_dietary_fiber/
uakua7,1650767585,always have solid rock poops right after a lot of D?,"I was prescribed constella many months ago to clear my intestines as I have severe ibs-c. I widdled down taking this medication to once a week as every time I take it, despite dose level, I have the runs, going up to 15-20 times in a day. This feels awesome after a week of slowly becoming more constipated however I have noticed that despite taking my laxative, supplementing with metamucil, water, exercise, and greens, it's like my body cannot clear itself. It's as if there's always areas of blockage. I could take my laxative, go pure liquid until the water is only slightly tinted brown, but that evening or the next morning have tiny pebble rock poops.

uaghyh,1650753062,"Advice and guidance needed, it’s making me miserable","In October 2021 I started feeling really nauseous, bloating, stomach pain and dizziness, after a night out this went on until January 2022. After multiple blood tests and stool samples a GI Doctor said that it is most likely Post Infectious IBS and there’s nothing I can do (charming). \n\nFor about 2 months I’ve been fine, eating healthier meals and having the odd takeaway every now and then and cups of tea in the morning. As of 1ST April 2022, I had a spicy burrito and ever since that day I have had constipation (still can open bowels for most part but I strain a lot and doesn’t fully empty), struggle to empty bladder fully, lower abdomen pain and excessive painful gas. I’ve tried eating a very bland diet, which hasn’t really changed anything, I’m aware that coffee usually makes it work and so does fried food but I’ve been making changes for weeks and I’m still nowhere. Please help me. \n\nI also have painful periods.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/uaghyh/advice_and_guidance_needed_its_making_me_miserable/
