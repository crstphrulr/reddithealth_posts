And my doctor couldn't give me a good answer either, and just told me to weigh the consequences.\n\nHas anyone here had their booster shot?

ue8c6u,1651188768,Eye Spasms &amp; Head Tremors,"A few years ago I started to get some pretty significant eye spasms where I would completely lose focus for a bit.  I googled causes at the time and I made sure I was hydrated, had electrolytes, took my vitamins, but the spasms continued in both eyes and I would lose focus completely until I closed my eyes and re-grouped.  Soon after, I started getting this head shaking thing going on when trying to concentrate on something or look and something intently.  I started getting them while also concentrating while driving.  \n\nI went to see my primary Dr. and since these tremors did not involve my hands, she ruled out Parkinsons and she did prescribe Primidone (an anti-seizure med) which I have been taking a low dose of for probably 2 years now.  She did offer to refer me to a Neurologist, but since the primidone sremed to help, I declined. \n\nNow, the head shaking is worse.  It is more sporadic and happens when I am not really concentrating on anything.  I think it is time to see a Neurologist for real now.  I have had other symptoms along with these eye spasms and head tremors.  I also have spasms in the back of my head that are so painful.  I have been reading about Dystonia and sometimes wonder if this is something I could have.  I am not trying to be a hypochondriac.  I am just trying to figure myself out and I will see a Neurologist.\n\nDoes anyone here with Dystonia share these same symptoms?  \n\nThank you in advance for any helpful advice.  ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonia/comments/ue8c6u/eye_spasms_head_tremors/

u6jvf0,1650306331,I'm just really tired. (Warning: this is a downer lol),"I have dopa-responsive dystonia plus syndrome. It's a form of generalized dystonia with parkinsonian symptoms. It's called a plus syndrome because my presentation is more severe than would be expected. My form leans more towards the Parkinson's side of things although without my medication the dystonia is so severe that I need assistive devices to move around and people to help me dress and things. Even eating and brushing teeth is a whole thing. On the medication the disease keeps throwing me curveballs. I'm doing everything right. My diet is very strict, I see a biokineticist every week and exercise as much as I can, I keep a strict sleep schedule, I don't smoke or drink or use substances, I've followed advice here and do meditation and breathing exercises (highly recommend lol it works well), I also see a therapist. Lol I guess you can say I'm always on the straight and narrow. \n\nI'm on carbilev 25/100 6 tablets daily and recently they added pramipexole to my regimen. I take it three times a day. It has made a huge difference. The past 6 months I lost my executive functioning. I couldn't remember anything, I couldn't formulate complete thoughts or put ideas together, I completely lost my ability to organise things and the pramipexole has really helped with that. It also improved my pain and dystonia quite a bit. So I'm able to do much more than before, but I'm still struggling to keep up with life. I can't go to campus often enough to do my lab work effectively. I'm currently only managing once a week. I'm not allowed to drive anymore so I'm losing my independence. \n\nI don't think I have a lot of time left to fulfil my aspirations. I'm already very sick and this disease is progressing quite rapidly. They say the progression only stops in your mid to late thirties. I'm 29 now. I'm just very tired. I feel like I'm fighting and doing my best, but my adversary is a god and I'm not doing any damage. As an example: I really wanted to go to the lab today. So I took a bath, blow-dried my hair and got dressed. And that was all the energy I had. I even had a mini episode afterwards in my feet and my legs. Though I must say rolling the spasms out with my rolling pin felt great.\n\nI don't have a good quality of life because I can't really do much. Going out with friends for example requires 2-3 days recovery; a week if I have a glass of wine. I don't see much of a future for myself if I can only handle one half a day's work a week at the moment. I think if I didn't have all my responsibilities and my family I would have called it, but I can't do that to them. So I'm venting on here instead.\n\nIf you got this far, thank you for reading. I hope you're doing better than I am.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonia/comments/u6jvf0/im_just_really_tired_warning_this_is_a_downer_lol/

Having a lot of pain in my toes and ankle- most often my toes curl and my foot turns inward so I’m walking on the side of my foot while also being somewhat pigeon-toed. Lots of pain- especially because I work on my feet, and life has been super stressful lately, which makes the Dystonia worse.  To add to the fun, I get tremors/myoclonus in the same leg so walking is… difficult. \n\nI just got referred to x rays and podiatry for the foot pain and PT for mobility/gait problems.

u10w68,1649657191,"At what point are muscle movements, spasms, tension, etc, considered dystonia rather than just normal occurences?","I ask this, since as person with ADHD, it's hard to tell how much of this sort of stuff I experience is due to ADHD or something else present. I tense when I focus, with the longer I focus, the more I tense, which seems to be regarded as somewhat normal for the most part, yet I seem to do this to such a degree that it really almost seems like I'm inducing actual dystonia in myself when I focus.\n\nMainly what I do is a type of tense breathing where essentially I keep breathing while holding the posture(all the stiffness and tenseness included) one has while holding their breath. This gets so bad that I end up physically exhausted and aching all over my torso after mentally strenuous tasks and medication prevents this from happening for a short time. My eyes also get droopy and heavy. Aside from those induced by focus, I'll get very one-off related symptoms like short muscle spasms and when I was a kid I used to do a lot of dystonic posturing but taught myself to not do such as I thought it seemed awkward.\n\nI talked to someone else with ADHD that tenses when focusing, but instead of doing the breathing thing like I do, they do more movement type things like curling their toes and also happen to have meds alleviate such for a short while. I haven't found anyone else with ADHD aside from that person which experiences those issues exactly as I do, though apparently some of this stuff isn't uncommon in ADHD.\n\nI just find it hard to gauge how significant all of these things are, since aside from the breathing thing I do, everything else is pretty mild and inconsequential to me. Not to mention, there's [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3652792/#__ffn_sectitle) mentioning the prevalence of motor regulation problems in ADHD people.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonia/comments/u10w68/at_what_point_are_muscle_movements_spasms_tension/

Went to the specialist and was told I had dystonic writers cramp and basically that it wasn't going to get better. He gave me the options (Botox and brain surgery) but advised I hold out because of the risks, costs, and the pain in the butt it can be to find the right spot to MAYBE get results. Basically a hard pass for me at this point. However the pain only really seems to be getting worse and so I was wondering, does anyone have any advice?\n\nLike should I be resting my hand, or working on trying to strengthen it? Wearing a brace or gloves for stability or is that worsening it? Is there an over the counter medication that would work best (muscle, nerve, arthritis?)

I as well as experience tremor throughout my whole shoulders and arms making me very shaky. I feel minimum jerking in my right hand thumb. This makes it hard to do various things with out treatments. I have been treating this with Botox/medication. Botox has been extremely helpful witch I also would have done every 3 months due to insurance coverage. My symptoms would return a little under 2 months but I would be able to manage until 3. I also am on clonazapam 1 mg 3x a day. This helps the muscles relax even more on top of the Botox but not normally do I need so much daily.

I'm going back to work at Amazon next and I am freaking out because I know the first week will be horrible. But if I survive, having a job will reduce other sources of stress. It feels like a catch-22.\n\nI can't take my normal anxiety meds anymore because they worsen the dystonia and fatigue. I can take stimulants for fatigue but they worsen the dystonia if I don't get the dose just right. I can do meditation and yoga, but that doesn't make external pressures go away.\n\nOn top of that, it's not like my life is particularly demanding. I have a lot of downtime, a supportive environment, and a decent disability income although it's about to end.

My neurologist has urged me for years to try it, but I hesitate for two reasons.\n\n1st is cost.

The pull is minimal (not noticable by anyone except doctors) and the pain is also minimal. It has been stable for about 10 years without any major changes. I feel I could justify the cost if it was causing me more problems, but at this stage I would rather spend money on other health issues that I deal with that cause more problems. The only reason I'm considering it is because my neurologist thinks they contribute to my migraines.

se1911,1643298110,FAITH Series Post 1: Brain body connection? It can go deeper,"Hi all,\n\nStarting this ""series"" to see if this can help those suffering on r/dystonia.\n\nYou don't know me yet so here are some reassurances. I'm not nuts. I'm not asking for money or selling a class. I'm just a doctor who is not giving medical advice but who has learned through his experiences things that health research cannot easily study.... because you cannot look at experiences with the world's best MRI's or CT scans. I felt failed by the medical system when I went to them but learned that the medical system is great at the good it does but is poorly equipped to handle chronic pain and chronic musculoskeletal issues.\n\nI am not doing this to try and be famous or whatever egotistic motives people try to get fame for.\n\nMy Faith series of post will try and introduce the concept of Faith vs. Fear. A lot of us don't like to admit we are scared or afraid of something, especially manly men like I was raised to be. That is a tragic way to see it because fear, like a lot of negative emotions, are our harshest teachers that can potentially toughen or harden us in ways that are more helpful than harmful.\n\nNone of you believe in easy answers by now, especially if you are on here and especially if you tried out different doctors and integrative or holistic practitioners.\n\nI'm here to try and teach deeper about pain. Right now society and most patients are on the surface level for pain. We are taught pain sucks, it is evil, it needs to be gone. We are numbed, operated on (oftentimes necessary, sometimes not...), and either self-taught or taught that our pain controls how we feel and think about our daily functioning and our prospects.\n\nThe trouble is, I have long understood that my brain during my worst pain states was not working well at all in terms of reasoning, learning, being accomodating, emotional control, making good decisions, being able to be resilient, etc. Bottom line, my brain in pain was not working and it took me a while to learn and accept that 100%.\n\nBecause pain brains are not optimal, I cannot simply ""teach"" what I learned. It is impossible. It is like me trying to teach you what a six flags roller coaster ride is like, not possible, all I can do is direct you and you have to ride the roller coaster.\n\nMy posts are intentionally long because they will weed out those who cannot read long stuff or do not want to commit. My theories and lessons from my own experiences are my own and I know it in my heart that it can help someone, that is why I am here. Right now I am a n=1, but I know this stuff must be able to help others.\n\nI still have my chronic pain and stiffness but I have gotten much more functional. I want you to follow me and check out future posts because they will build on each other. See my prior posts and if my material resonates with you, follow me and I promise to try and be on here more but I am very busy with work and family so sometimes I'll be absent for awhile.\n\nFirst lesson, the prison of our minds can be a literal prison. See this video:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaRO5-V1uK0&amp;t=5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaRO5-V1uK0&amp;t=5s)  \n\n\nWhile watching this, feel your mind and body as much as you can. Feel whatever feelings come about from watching this guy. Get used to feeling your body and brain... it will be overwhelming at times so when that happens, treat that as information that you need a break from feeling. Feelings and emotions are super complicated and hard to teach even a mature smart adult. We all have issues with feelings if we had poor modeling behavior from parental figures and poor experiences from our environment. Our smart brains can't help but learn lessons that may have been appropriate at the moment but are no longer helpful but even harmful in the present.\n\nThink about your mind and if it is more fear based or faith based. No mind is just one thing or the other, it's always a mix of both. Some things in life you are more faith based (hobbies, video games, things that are fun for you to do). You know this cuz when you're doing it, your mind is busy doing it and you're too happy to notice much else. See how you breathe, think and move in these states compared to the opposite fear states that happen when something stressful is happening or the body is in pain. See how you breathe, move, and think in these situations. Get familiar with it.\n\nAll my experiences taught me things with very simple concepts that are very hard to execute but provide a lot of good in the end... those things are holy. Movement is holy. Thinking optimally is holy. I am not going to bring religion or god but I have to point out the word holy is underappreciated so you will hear me say it.\n\nHope this video helps. If you're feeling tense today, practice taking deep breaths or humming. I'll make a humming video to demonstrate one day but it really is simple, take in a long slow inhale and then let it out in a hum and draw out the hum as long as you can. Rinse and repeat. See what happens to your body and mind during the course. Try it out for awhile and practice having fun with it because it is very annoying and can be irritating at first. Listen to good muscle while doing one tone hum. The trick this does can be google searched.\n\nMuch love all, I'll be back again soon!

sdpaj6,1643256150,First of a series of posts to try and improve my own understanding of Dystonia and hopefully help with what I learned to reduce suffering so I can function better,"Hi All!\n\nLong time lurker, medical doctor in primary care but not here to give medical advice.\n\nLong time chronic pain patient. Used to have off and on pains since 5th grade and lots of injuries as a kid and adult). Pain affected seemingly all over but especially right side of body parts like neck, r lower back, r lower hip, r thigh, r inner knee, right foot. Lots of crepitus. The past six years these parts got super stiffer and noticeably affecting how I was walking (felt like I was spending less time on my left foot - I was right). The past 2 years was especially scary for me since I could no longer sit/stand/or lay flat on my back for more than 10-20 min w/o being super tense, uncomfortable, in pain, feeling burning in different areas of my body that were in contact with a surface. I especially hated sitting but I could not find a comfortable position. I was scared of becoming permanently disabled. \n\nStarting in Sept 2021, I tried different modalities of treatments all at the same time. Each one deserves its own post in the future. My symptoms were so confusing but fit the ""syndrome"" of fibromyalgia. I put syndrome in quotes because it is a word doctors use to describe a condition that doesn't have a definite known cause, not unlike many forms of dystonia. As a doc who trained in a top 20 US allopathic med school and top residencies in both surgical and primary care training, I did not know wth was causing my symptoms other than a bunch of theories... accumulation of injuries (3 car accidents, 1 motorcycle accident, wrestling injuries, etc). What was strange was I always felt my body was stronger on my right side and I also had a right middle rib sticking forward. I used to get these sudden sharp left chest pain symptoms where I thought I was dying (and later diagnosed with costochondritis and panic attacks).\n\nAfter the past 6 months, I was able to regain a lot of functioning. I am not trying to be coy, I cannot describe the entire experience in one or several posts... and the concepts I learned are going to be tricky to teach... But I'm hoping it will help u guys be in less pain, so you can live more.\n\nAnyways, I want to start a movement to try and see if I can help out members of r/dystonia so please help by upvoting.\n\nFirst, I want to teach really complex concept in simple terms so everyone might benefit or at least understand what I am trying to say.\n\nNext, none of this is medical advice. It is just education (and hopefully entertainment) purposes. I am not your doctor but I am your friend\n\nThird, I will not say I can completely understand the suffering that some (or all) of you are going through, but let's just say I can intimately understand how the pain and suffering can affect both body and brain and vice versa, and back and forth... propagating a negative perpetual feedback look that takes a toll on both your brain and body. I am not a guru or expert. I am still a student of my own body and experiences but I have learned so much in the past six months that I hope I can help someone else.... so I'm starting here first.\n\nFourth, I will have to ask for your full faith that I am not trying to sell you snake oil or trick you into subscribing or buying anything. I have published several papers back in the day so I am aware of both strengths and weaknesses of our medical system (especially in area of Research... studies tend to follow the $$$). So there is no way that what I learned will ever be tested at a US academic medical institute. So you guys who commit... please keep r/dystonia updated if any benefits over the next few months that you experience from trying out some of my suggestions... Please share as much or as little but fingers crossed for posts that show positive understanding and improvement in quality of life. Please remember the word FAITH, for reasons quickly discussed below.\n\nOk this is an essay, this will be my first share so let me provide the simple lessons and dive deep into each.\n\nFirst, I imagine most of you (not all) grew up in stressful environments. Unfortunately some (or more) parents are not the best at handling stress so that can transfer to their kids.\n\nMost of us grew up in (what I like to call) ""fear based environments"". My parents were first gen immigrants, we were poor and they argued and cried over money. Anxiety, fear, worry was my only childhood friend. I went on to add more fear based friends like insecurity (was overweight as a kid and bulimic for many years). I was depressed but never admitted it and over-compensated by trying to seem happy to everyone else. I never knew how fear, anxiety, stress, and all the many negative states of emotions and feelings can affect the body until the past two years when I was in my worst pain. When I got mad, I felt it in my body in my upper back muscles, tightening up like a electric shock that ran across it. It hurt, I could only take shallow breaths. It was astonishing how much I felt my stress in those days.\n\nI now know that emotions, pain, suffering can be ""used"" in a different way... not from a view of fear, but from a view of faith.\n\nFor the first few suggestions (these will take everyone who choose to try out several weeks/months):\n\n1. Check out ""Wim Hof Breath Technique"" on youtube. When I do them, I follow his rules of **not forcing myself, listening to my body and having fun** (I wrote these down and posted on my wall, I used these rules for everything in life now). While doing these, it might feel weird and even downright scary so be in a safe place and have a good fun attitude that this is just experimenting with getting used to how the body can feel just through breathing. I am not sponsored by Wim but bonus points if you sign up for his Fundamentals Course. That was gold for me. Ask your doctor if you're not sure if it is safe to participate, not everyone can do this. Also, treat this as physical activity, breathing requires A LOT of muscles all over the body so go slow and try it for short periods. Listen to fun music while doing it or whatever brings you joy. The deeper purpose of his techiniques (including cold shower exposures) are to get someone more used to feeling stressed in a gentle way... while also seeing how stress can be relieved through breathing and breathing can really charged up the body. When I do this, I feel intense relaxation all over and as if my body's tight areas would relax. These are temporary but it gives a great appreciation for breathing.\n2. Read Napolean Hill's ""Outwitting the Devil"". This book will teach how the mind can work against us. In those of us who grew up with fear based parents or environments, we learned a lot of rules that sometimes can be more harmful to ourselves and those around us than helpful. Even if you are not religious or believe in the devil, this book is incredibly powerful in teaching about the mind... trust me, check out the audio book if you must. \n3. Do more and more relaxing techniques and learn new ones. Try out yoga or if you are physically able to, join something like title boxing gym where you get to put on gloves and punch away at a bag with lots of music. Have a blast, I even saw frail old grannies there who can't punch hard but they give it their best shot :)\n4. Come back here from time to time to ask questions or update progress. I hope this helps someone out. If it really helps, create a new post in r/dystonia and make sure to reference this post please ;)\n\nI will come back from time to time to post new suggestions and share some more experiences and insights... gonna be many posts but weeks at a time... I am super busy and have a family so I cannot respond to everyone or DM, but will try to get back to people from time to time on posts.\n\nBest wishes for all. ABC (always breath check). if you are tense, you likely are not taking deep breaths. When this happens, take a break or lay down on the ground, whatever it takes so you can take deep breaths!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonia/comments/sdpaj6/first_of_a_series_of_posts_to_try_and_improve_my/

sbg1wq,1643007862,Nerve Blocks - Cervical Dystonia Experiment,"Long story short it didn't work for me. In fact it made everything worse, including daily tension headaches.😢\n\nI knew going into it that it was a 50/50 shot it would give me some relief. The procedure itself wasn't bad at all. It was guided injection with ultrasound. I got the shot right in the left greater occipital nerve. For some reason my pain doctor decided to add some trigger point injections to the left muscle as well - those usually made things worse for me but I figured it won't be so bad since he is blocking the actual nerve that goes into that muscle. I was wrong. \n\nThe day off I felt the best with my head being numb from the anastethtic - wish that lasted longer. The next day it was ok and then it went downhill from there. I started getting daily tension headaches in the back of my head and slowly started feeling horrible pain in the muscle, mainly the occipital area. I tried all the OTC painkillers and nothing was touching it. I reached out to the pain doc and he advised I take muscle relaxers and see if that helps. It did after a couple of days. I'm still baffled how this shot and trigger point could have caused my muscle to spasm so much. I literally got the opposite of what that treatment was supposed to do. \n\nI did take a risk out of desperation because Botox only lasts 4-5 weeks for me. And I knew that it might not work but I had no idea it can make things worse. The lesson I learned here is my nerves and muscles hate cortisteroids, and I am going to stay away from those for good.\n\nFor some people it works great and some ot doesn't.

s8kz0l,1642691050,Long time lurker here…my story with CD may be a little weird.,"Hi guys so I’ve had what I believe to be cervical dystonia for about 10 years now. I spent about 8 of those years suffering in silence as a kid though, hiding my symptoms and chalking it up to social anxiety. *sigh*. I say I “believe” because I got diagnosed after an evaluation by a neurologist but sometimes I feel like my TMJ symptoms and uneven jaw joints might be causing the problem. I’ve had success with Botox maybe 2/5 times. One dose was excellent. Stopped all my tremoring and i barely felt the pull. Not sure if it’s working anymore though. I don’t have too much pain, just after a long day of dealing with the pull when it’s bad. I only remember once in my life when for the first time I felt symptoms of depression, my tremors just kinda disappeared???? Haven’t been depressed since then, thankfully, but I get spasms and tremors on and off. Flexeril before bed helps sometimes the next day, but i haven’t found long-term relief. I do my stretches and try to exercise, but it’s kinda just “some days are better than others.” \n\nI’m wondering if I should get my TMJ checked?

rtzums,1641092434,Blepharospasm post Moderna Vaccine,"-Not anti vaccine, just describing exactly how my symptoms appeared-\n\n27 F, I got my first dose of the Moderna Vaccine on 9/02/2021. Had nothing unusual occurred until 2 weeks later when I was meditating and noticed my both of my eyes started contracting shut on their own. I had the ability to stop the contraction if I thought about it, however, if I was resting with my eyes closed they would squeeze shut involuntarily. The contractions started as fluttering or spasticity(similar to REM cycle sleep) but  then progressed to slower, stronger, and rhythmic contractions that lasted anywhere 5-10+ seconds. I had some other weird neurological symptoms that co-occurred during this time such as right scalene and SCM tightness, weird tongue sensations, and tingling sensations around my right buccal region. These symptoms peaked around 1 month after my first dose but slowly started to get a little better day by day. Throughout this time, I had great difficulty sleeping as my eyes would involuntarily contract and had a lot of anxiety as I was 100% healthy before this occurred. I have seen a resident and a PCP twice, a neurologist, and an ophthalmologist. None of them have seen anything like it but the resident, PCP, and ophthalmologist believe it maybe an adverse reaction. My neurologist told me it’s just anxiety and it will go away but I’m still not normal 4 months later.\n\nMy main reason for posting this is to see if anyone else has experienced anything similar?

rpx62a,1640638747,I feel lost,"LONG POST SORRY BUT IF YOU CAN PLEASE HELP\n\nSo for 10 months I have been dealing with tightness in my neck. Particularly in the SCM and on the right side. My range of motion is very limited. Along with the tightness I have some weakness. When i get out of bed in the morning my head will shake. When I do push ups or sit ups I shake as well. \n\nHow it started: I blacked out from drinking alcohol at my apartment. I didn't go anywhere I just stayed in my apartment watching football. The next day I woke up with what felt like a kink in my neck and I had slept wrong. I didn't think much of it for 30 days an expected it to go away. However it did not. I then saw a doctor who diagnoses me with muscle spasms and sent me to Physical Therapy. The physical therapist thought it was a pinched nerve or a muscle strain. After the first session of PT i felt great. I was positive and felt like it could be a turning point. The next day however my roommate punched me in the face during an argument. After that I felt like I have not recovered. The PT I was doing was no longing helping. I was carrying myself very stiff because I didn't know what my diagnosis was. I was trying to hold my neck still. I continued to do PT. \n\nFast forward 4 months I move back with my parents and have an MRI of my brain, neck and spine because I was still very tight. The MRI comes back normal. I then proceeded to work with a chiropractor. I did about 15 sessions and saw minor improvement. We mostly did grastin and adjustments. \n\nFast forward 3 months I try a new physical therapist. He basically thinks that my body and nervous system is in protect mode. It is somewhat stuck in fight or flight and wont let go. I proceed to do sessions with him 2 times a week for 3 months. I see results but no matter what the next day I am still very tight and have a limited range of motion. We mostly did minor manuel therapy and strength training. \n\n2 weeks ago I met with a *physiatrist* t who said in his opinion it is either a slow recovering muscle strain or something of that sorts or it is Cervical Dystonia. So he proceeded to order a Nerve Conduction and EMG test. Both come back normal.\n\nSo here I am 10 months in. Ive seen improvements but Im nowhere near my normal self. The limited range of motion is arguably the most frustrating as I often have to compensate by turning my body. I feel like Im at rock bottom and genuinely dont know if I can live my life in this state for the rest of my life. I am young 24 years old. Ive been active my whole life besides a decrease due to the pandemic. I cant find anyone or anything going through something similar. I am truly lost and need help. \n\nOne other thing I will add is ive also tried massage therapy. It has helped a little bit but the same with PT and Chiro the next day the progress is minimal and the tightness is very prevalent. Please help me anyone who can point me in the right direction here. \n\nMY SYMPTOMS: tightness in my neck and back, limited range of motion, tingling above my right eyebrow, muscle weakness when doing push ups or core training, shaky neck when against gravity(getting out of bed, doing a sit up, etc.) \n\nTESTS IVE HAD DONE: MRI, Nerve Conduction and EMG",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonia/comments/rpx62a/i_feel_lost/
rpwm6m,1640637186,In the early learning stages of figuring out a dystonia nightmare.,"Hi folks,\n\nThis is going to be a long post but I think it would help me to get it out there and I appreciate anyone taking the time to read or comment.\n\nI'm a 33 year old life long outdoor laborer whose career as a land surveyor came to a screeching halt 18 months ago due to chronic severe neck and shoulder pain that was intermittent for years but became a permanent, disabling fixture of my life. My physical situation is complicated because I also have a severe hip injury in my dominant leg that no one could figure out and left me all twisted up for so long that my left leg had to take over as dominant and my historically very strong right leg shrunk up. On top of this, I lived with a broken rib cage (broken joints between ribs 6-8 of the costal margin) for 18 years and no doctor would ever listen to me about it. I had to diagnose myself with an exceptionally rare set of thoracic outlet syndrome (veinous and neurogenic) and slipped rib syndrome (but way worse than what that usually means). I then found some of the best doctors in the world for these problems at Boston hospitals. They were both doubtful that i could have all of what I told them was going on. The guy who literally wrote the textbook in thoracic outlet syndrome flat out denied that I could have both syndromes and refused to examine my rib cage. He said the combination of things would be like winning the lottery. Welp, he has since eaten his words after a chest wall reconstruction specialist opened me up to find that my costal margin was brutally damaged and he tied my ribs back together in a one of a kind surgery. That was at the end of August.\n\nI didn't know what cervical dystonia was until i read in my chart that the TOS doctor was confident I had it. He didn't even tell me in person. Spasmodic torticollis, sustained head tilt, etc in his notes. Suddenly, after years of being treated like garbage, all medical staff are kind to me.\n\n Botox helped the first time but not the second. I am constantly injuring my brachial plexus on the left side  and sometimes my jugular as well. I get bouts of numbness in the left side of my mouth, throat, face, neck, left arm and shoulder, and diaphragm. No one takes it that seriously even though you can easily visualize the damage to my jugular because I present as an exceptionally fit and healthy young man. I am on workers comp. and the TOS doctor wants to remove my pec minor muscle in goes of stabilizing my thoracic outlet but I'm not confident that he is correct.\n\nUpon learning more about dystonia, I believe it is what damaged my right leg and hip as well. I'd like to learn what the cause of my dystonia is and what kind it is but I have not seen any doctors about it specifically yet. It could very well be a result of repeated oxygen depravation in early childhood because I almost died of asthma and pneumonia a number of times. I can remember being rushed past very full ER lobbies a number of times due to the triage nurse seeing my O2 stats at intake. But I also wonder if I have suffered brain damage resulting from my thoracic outlet pinching off my vitals while sleeping. \n\nWhat I do know is that it might be dopamine responsive dystonia because oxycodone and gabapentin made my spazzy muscles relax more than they had in years. I only took those sheet the surgery though and I really don't want to become dependent on drugs.\n\nHere is a list of things that have helped me in absence of medical support and having to take a thousand stabs in the dark:\n\nHanging upside-down from ankle hooks. This untwists my cervical spine like nothing else, even if it's just for a little while, it is such a relief. No doctor will ever recommend it but I know it's a huge help to me and probably would help others.\n\nKratom- I order from super speciosa. This has been a healthier, safer alternative to painkillers for me. I only use it when I'm at my worst. Gabapentin robbed me of my dexterity for playing piano and dulled my brain too much. Kratom on the other hand makes me feel good enough to want to play and does not negatively impact my dexterity at all.\n\nA breathing exercise from the Postural Restoration Institute - if anyone is curious, ask me for a link.\n\nThe Wim Hof method which is a combination of a breathing exercise and taking a freezing cold shower everyday. I've only just started but I can already tell that the breathing exercise is impacting my dystonia muscles and the cold shower without a doubt reduces pain. I'm hopeful that continuing to do this will help.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas of where to go in new england for medical help to better understand what I'm going through, please let me know. I'm terrified that I'm going to continue to get worse and worse despite dedicating my entire life to trying to prevent it. Add on a high profile workers comp case and ask the regular stressors of life and it's pretty overwhelming. I don't know how to go forward because i don't know if I'll ever be physically stable enough to hold a job or even have a normal social life. I spend almost all of my time alone and it feels necessary to do so even though I would like to get a girlfriend and maybe have a family someday.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonia/comments/rpwm6m/in_the_early_learning_stages_of_figuring_out_a/

And ever since then I’ve had steadily worsening symptoms in my whole body,but especially neck and face.  I’m always in the process of adjusting my device.  But I’m curious what parts of spasms trigger the most daily anger for other movement disorder sufferers.\n\nBefore I realized my face and neck spasms were dystonia I was barely aware of them except that I got extremely angry much of the time.  Once it was diagnosed as my symptoms spreading, the anger got a little under control.\n\nDo you guys think anger comes primarily with worsening or new symptoms? Because of the uncertainty and fear of losing control? Or do you identify your anger as a direct result of the pain.\n\nAlso, how do you manage your anger? \nOften I won’t even be aware that my symptoms are particularly bad until I ask myself “why am I so angry right now? nothing seems to be going on” And then I bring awareness to my body to find that I have a persistent spasm in my calf or neck.\n\nJust like a spasming calf can turn into tight body by way of undermining healthy body mechanics, and involving incorrect muscle groups in movements(like pushing forward with your hip muscle in order to walk instead of letting the leg fall naturally forward pulled only by momentum) Can dissociating yourself from a body part turn into dissociation from other parts of the self? Or promote generally wrong mechanics of processing pain?\n\nMaybe movement disorders just take the hope from control out of a person and undermine ambition (like no matter what goal I accomplish my anger and pain will be here with me)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonia/comments/r27g5l/spasms_anger/

Fast forward to mid 20’s, discovered that the pain/cramps I’ve had in my calves since I was &lt;5yo is dystonia too, but felt “different” to me + I was told it was “growing pains” my entire childhood. ET has progressed/spread considerably, and have also developed situation dependent dystonic tremor in my hands/feet/head over the years. \n\nI’m not even sure when it started bc it’s been a slow progression, but I started noticing less sensation in my feet maybe 5 yrs ago. Could still feel the quick poking/vibration testing done by PC. Occasional pain/prickling sensations/itching. Mentioned it to both PC and Neuro over the years, but they didn’t seem very concerned. Realized over the summer when stepping into a hot tub that I could barely feel the temp until I got to my thighs. \n\nI also have epilepsy, which was my neuro’s main concern over the last few years. Finally got a movement specialist referral (after asking several times), and saw them a month ago. Was honestly less informative and helpful than I was expecting. They offered Botox injections, but said I should see Rheumatology first for “perceived sensation loss”. Didn’t do any poking/prodding of my feet. Mostly just looked at my tremor and dystonia symptoms and confirmed what I knew already. \n\nA week later I started PT for ankle instability. (I rolled my right ankle a year ago and broke my foot. Fracture healed but I was still having pain/rolling my ankles a lot). During the PT consult she did “2 point discrimination testing” and I failed miserably on my feet and ankles. Said I should let Neuro know bc the the pattern I failed in was consistent with peripheral neuropathy. Messaged both my regular Neuro and MS- both offered follow up appts months from now. I asked if either could order NCS/EMG since I saw both of them recently, both said no w/o follow up appt. My rheumatologist appt is in 2 weeks, so I’m hoping they will order them and have more general insight. \n\nI also confirmed with my PC that vitamin deficiencies that can cause PN were checked recently and normal. I also have recent normal MRI’s of my brain and spine. I’ve gotten mixed responses between doctors about if PN could be dystonia related from repeated stress/injury. \n\nTLDR- 29yo, I have dystonia in my limbs (~25yrs lower, ~15yrs upper), and progression of peripheral neuropathy like symptoms for ~5yrs.

qpg1le,1636385573,"Parkinson's, Dystonia, and Cycling."," \n\nParkinsons and Cycling\n\nMy son and I enjoyed a fantastic Saturday bike ride, perfect weather.\n\nIt was a fundraiser for Ride Ataxia. Friedreich ataxia (also called FA) is a rare inherited disease that causes progressive nervous system damage and movement problems. It usually begins in childhood and leads to impaired muscle coordination (ataxia) that worsens over time. In Friedreich, ataxia nerve fibers in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves degenerate, becoming thinner.\n\nMy son drove us up Friday night after he got off work; we got in around 10 PM.  The alarm is set for 6:45, just enough time to get up, get some breakfast, and head to the bike ride about 15 minutes away.\n\nThe room locked us out! After breakfast, we couldn't get back into the room, got new card keys, nope didn't do it. Maintenance came up with his electronic to reset the reader. Tha Didn't work. Tools to disassemble to the door finally got us back into the room to get our stuff and head out.\n\nSo we got there a little later than planned and missed the part about ""if you do the 27 miles, you have blue markers, the 50 mile has green markers."" Turns outBrain-DerivedNeurotropic all signs are blue, but there are either blue or green arrows to indicate direction on the ground. Years past has gotten windy, hence markers on the pavement.\n\nSo we missed the first sign to turn left (thinking that was for the 27-mile route). Oops. It turns out in our haste to depart, we both had tossed the route sheet into the truck. Oops. \n\nI was trying to time my medication (during intense rides, I need my meds every two hours to keep dystonia away, I usually do fine with taking them every four hours but go on my hour-long workouts and walk for right after taking medication)\n\nThe morning was colder. 40F, not too bad. I had a Merino wool base layer on my torso, but just wearing shorts. Gloves to keep my hands warm, so it felt slow but good. My speeds were lower than usual. \n\nIn Texas, they are using more ""chip seal."" Old roads had a base layer, crushed rock, top smooth layer. That has changed as they don't do a top soft layer for cost-saving but leave the crushed stone and let traffic imbed into the pavement.   Hard on vehicles (rock dings, cracked windshields, tires wear out faster) but saves the county money on road maintenance. Not too bicycle-friendly.\n\nIt felt like I was putting in a much higher effort than I usually would have.\n\nFirst rest stopped we passed, as I had just taken medication and still had plenty of water.   The day before, I had skipped dinner and had only yogurt to swallow my vitamin stack as it was a compressed morning (take meds, wait 30 minutes, eat breakfast).  This morning it was getting out of bed, taking meds, head down to breakfast.\n\nSo I am pushing it on the bike. My mind is trying to figure out if I am low on medication (dystonia kicking in), not enough food (we need food to keep cycling, but that only happens after a few hours of cycling), lack of sleep, or just that darn chip seal roads messing with me.\n\nWe make it to the mid-point stop, 25 miles in, only to realize I have a flat tire! Darn it.  Pop the wheel off, pull the tube, tiny torn got through the sidewall. Toss in a spare tube, pump it off, and off we go. Feel much better to have much lower rolling resistance.\n\nStill, the chip seal was wearing me down. Maybe just on off day, fatigue kicking in, but I'm not going take a sag wagon but finish the ride!\n\nWe finish around 2:00 PM. My moving speed for the ride was 10.8 mph—one of the slowest rides to date. Usually, I am closer to 15 mph, but for a 50 mile, my body felt like it had been a 100-mile ride—flat tire.\n\nIn our haste of swapping out the tube, I failed to snug the Presta valve. So it was a slow air leak on the second half of the ride. \n\nSo the whole time, I kept thinking, ""is my medication off? Have I been drinking enough water? Is it the lack of food causing issues?"" Yet it was \n\nsimple flat tire.\n\nSo don't overlook little things when taking care of yourself. While this was more of an intense ride than planned, all is good when it comes to BDNF\n\n(Brain Derived Neurotopical Factors)\n\n# Exercise Can Raise BDNF Levels, Alleviate Depression in Parkinson's Patients, Review Shows LINK\n\nhttps://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/2018/10/15/bdnf-levels-are-abnormally-low-in-patients-with-parkinsons-disease/?utm\_source=PAR+E-mail+List&amp;utm\_campaign=72e97e0767-RSS\_WEEKLY\_EMAIL\_CAMPAIGN\_DAILY\_US&amp;utm\_medium=email&amp;utm\_term=0\_62dd4fb5e3-72e97e0767-71741409",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonia/comments/qpg1le/parkinsons_dystonia_and_cycling/

My last post was a photo of my handwriting when I **thought** we got the Dystonia was under control. \n\nSpoiler: nope. \n\nI was diagnosed with focal Dystonia at 14 (thought it was 12, was wrong). I’m 25 now. The bad symptoms had been focal in nature until I got off of a med regimen that included clonazepam and a medication used for Parkinson’s (Artane). I built a tolerance to the clonazepam and did a bunch of research on benzos and decided I didn’t want to be on it at all, much less continue to go up in dose. \n\nWell. Since coming off of those meds, I felt like the new routine (using Baclofen in place of clonazepam) wasn’t working. My tremors were no longer controlled and I was having muscle twitches all over my body. I thought it would go away. It’s only gotten worse over the last month. \n\nI started getting tremors &amp; twitches in my feet and my legs last week. Both feet also now bend the toes inward randomly &amp; cramp up. My left hand has trouble typing now, and I’ve noticed that it CAN write, but day by day it’s getting more shaky and weak, and is starting to curl like my right one does. That’s how it all started in my right hand. \n\nI started noticing my left hand changing last year. I tried to ignore it, despite my neurologist telling me he could see it spreading to the left side two years ago just from looking at my shoulder alignment. Apparently I thought my own stubbornness and internal denial would make him be wrong. (This is a theme in this post.)\n\nI tested negative for DYT-1 and DYT-6. \n\nI couldn’t remember my password to this account, so I used another one to post here (u/not_a_sandwich90) about the medications a day or two ago. The comments on that post got me thinking, and I do think going ahead with DBS is the way to go at this point. I don’t want to, but I think I’d regret NOT doing it more than I’ll regret doing it. I took a silent hour today and just sat and thought about what I wanted my life to look like. Do I want to get back on the clonazepam knowing I could *maybe* mask some of it until it gets to a point of needing to up the dose beyond a certain point? Do I want to continue life being dependent on a benzo? No &amp; no. I want to fix the source, aka my rude brain.\n\nDystonia sucks, but I’m thankful to have a family in this subreddit. I’m sorry if I got anyone’s hopes up with my last post on this account, but I hope this one finds all of you in a good place. \n\nI’ve caved and had to face reality, but I’m keeping my stubbornness alive a bit and will not put off grad school because I know it will bring me joy and strength both pre and post-DBS. Dystonia has robbed me of enough joy already, it doesn’t get to keep grad school away, too. I’ve already had to wait two years to get all of the failed Botox experiments done. Foot is firmly down. Bite me, @dystonia. \n\nI’m not sure how I’m going to deal with DBS in grad school, or how I’m going to come up with the money for the deductible of my student health insurance (lol), but I trust that everything turns out the way it’s meant to. I’m just glad I know I can talk to y’all. \n\nTl;dr: my focal Dystonia is not actually focal and I can no longer write like my last post showed. It has spread to other areas of my body at 25 years old. I will take my medical team at UT Southwestern up on proceeding *towards* DBS, while in the early spreading stages, instead of away from it. Mayo also said we need to move toward DBS, just based on my medical records, but my in denial self didn’t agree and wouldn’t go through with it. On that note, I have learned I’m very good at being in denial. I also learned that Dystonia is still very, very rude.\n\nThankful for y’all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonia/comments/qp4amz/over_the_river_and_through_the_woods_to_dbs_we_go/

I can hardly go five seconds without having to readjust myself. My neck makes a cracking sound like cracking knuckles. And it isn't just a simple shift backwards like I used to have it, these days I have to rotate my neck multiple times and clench it with my hands while I'm doing so to provide support. It's painful and damn unfortunate timing, as I recently started off in a new high school and this isn't the way I want to present myself. I've tried my luck with Tiger Balm and while it does help somewhat, the strong odor of it sticks to you for two days so it's not optimal. \n\nI'd never even heard about cervical dystonia until about two days ago in my health sciences class. I looked it up and watched a video titled ""A Patient With Severe Cervical Dystonia."" As I saw it I thought, ""Holy shit, that's just like me!""

qcdx1j,1634772404,Is this my life now?,"I’m glad to have found this sub. I was recently diagnosed with dystopia from my neurologist. I’ve had years and years of pain from a 25 years ago car accident- but it was mainly more of a achy/dull pain in both jaw (initially diagnosed as TMJ) and neck that could be cured by massage and occasional chiropractic. I always felt it but it wasn’t severe and didn’t impact my daily life. I have a family, career, travelled, exercised. \n\nThen about 2.5 years ago I had an anxiety attack triggered by low magnesium and potassium and was in the hospital for 2 days. I had been wearing myself down with traveling weekly for work, going through a divorce and all the stress. I think my body just broke down. My neck was its normal “pain level 3-4” bad. It started to get worse about 5 months later and I still had the anxiety. I went to my doctor, we did facet injections on the C4-5. It felt great for 2 days bc it was numb. Then, no change. So then we tried another joint injection a couple months later. Nothing. He didn’t think dystopia yet- was treating me for arthritis, andI do have some disk degeneration. My neck kept getting worse and worse- I couldn’t sit at a desk for a full day, I’m now depressed and my partner is buying me  massage gun, neck pillows, neck stretchers, heating pads, a new chair.. anything to make it better. Nothing works. I am on constant pain. My doc did a nerve block at the base of the skull which showed some improvement. I also went to a chiropractor who did dry needling, tens, cupping, and some neurological eye exercises- which did the most good. \n\nLast month I went back to my doctor to discuss more options. He said it’s dystonia, nerve ablation won’t work. He starts the insurance case for Botox. I can’t get scheduled for 6 weeks. Next week I finally go- for 200 units to start. \n\nI am putting all my cards in this basket. My neck feels RIGID, the pain is so bad right now. I just started the biggest job I’ve ever had and I’m so scared I’ll have to quit and try to get disability bc of the pain. I’m afraid my partner will leave me. I am so tired and in pain at the end of a work day. I can’t be there enough for my kids. I’m so scared this isn’t going to work. I’ve researched everything on this sub- so I know the pain meds to ask for (I have Valium but don’t take it bc I can’t work on it and it doesn’t work. I have emergency Xanax I can take but it too makes me sleepy). I know to call Mayo Clinic. \n\n I’m sorry for the novel but no one understands and I’m sure everyone is tired of hearing about it. I never thought I’d have chronic pain- but I guess now I do. I just want any improvement at all and I’m so scared the Botox won’t work. \n\nTake care everyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonia/comments/qcdx1j/is_this_my_life_now/

I took a year off for rehab because I couldn't walk anymore and someone had to teach me again. I did it. I still see her for physical therapy once a week. I do the exercises she suggests as much as I can. I eat a healthy vegetarian diet (unfortunately meat worsens my condition) and take multiple supplements : a multivitamin, omega 3 and 6, vitamin E (there was a sale).

Both my long-term and short-term memory are bad. It's gotten to the point where I have sticky notes up all over my house to remind me to lock the doors and to put my shoes on before I leave. I'm also forgetting important meetings at work, tasks that need to be done, important conversations about my project. Reminders don't help at all. As soon as I turn away the information is gone. The other thing is that I am having a hard time understanding people sometimes. It's more with spoken word. Sometimes it sounds alien at first and then normal when I ask them to repeat themselves. It's more an attention problem. I can't seem to focus on anything for more than a few minutes and I often catch myself just sitting with nothing happening upstairs. I find I have to relearn concepts and it takes me longer to understand things than it used to. This started last month and it feels like it's getting worse quite rapidly.

pi5pnv,1630813010,Difficulties with relationships,"Hello, I am Tom. Everyone writes about themselves something I'll try that too. I've been diagnosed 3 years ago with cervical dystonia at the age of 24 and my problems started about a year prior to that. Most of the time it feels bad but after reading through your posts I'm kind of hesitant to say so. My symptoms are almost invisible, from time to time I am shaking which lasts hours and is exhausting but I got used to it, I'm  a little tilted to the left side, it is nicely presented in my chair in the office which is a little tilted to the left too, than there is fatigue and the pain, which is bad and sometimes worse, as I gave up on botox after 2 years without any positive effect and I refused pills because I know I have really addictive personality plus the pain is tolerable, most of the time. I work in the office, my profession is software engineer and it allows me to work from home whenever I need to, which is nice. And for one or two weeks in a year I enjoy to pretend that nothing like dystonia exists and nothing limits me, take 30kg bag on my back and head off to hitchhike some exotic country with few buddies. It needs a lot of will, it takes all the energy and you can't stand up from a bed for few weeks afterwards but it is totally worth! \n\nNow the relationships. As you are diagnosed many things change, many things begins to move at that point and the change comes over time. I am introverted, very calm kind of silent guy who enjoys to observe the world around him, always have been. I'm lucky for my friends, there is many of them, they adopted me, always asks me if I want to hang out, but do not really pressure me into it so I'm not alone, really love them. And although I was never an alpha with ladies, I had few girlfriends and 2 serious relationships. Since my diagnose 3 years ago, I've been with two girls, each for few months, both I dated before the diagnosis. Lately I realized that for that whole time I haven't established intimate relationship with women except for those two. It's not that I haven't met any, there was always good excuse not to start anything right at that moment. I thought about it for a while and it's just inconvenient, how do you tell a girl that you have dystonia, or do you even? feels like you should. But doesn't it objectively move you to the end of the ladder, behind all the ""healthier"" people? How do you deal with sudden mood flips from something ""invisible"" and other stuff. \n\nAnd few other questions: \nDo you have tips for sleeping? I hate sleeping on just one side, because the other hurts to sleep on, but then the one that I sleep on everyday is icky and overslept on for a whole day. :)\nDo any of you, who read it to this point, work in the office and sit for a whole day? It gets really uncomfortable after few hours to sit at one place in one position, even though I take a lot of breaks to walk around and reorder bones in my body. \n\nThis is longer than I thought it would be and sounds like terribly written episode from soap opera, try to ignore that please.

p1f8sk,1628559040,What do you pay for Botox injections?,"Hello all,\n\nI was recently diagnosed with hemi-dystonia caused by a rare genetic mutation. It took many months of imaging, blood tests and finally a genetic test to get diagnosed. My dystonia is present in my left hand and left foot. I have difficulty bending my fingers (mainly my ring and middle fingers) and my toes curl on their own. \n\nI tried a few trials of medications, but ultimately those were stopped because they didn't help. About a month ago I received Botox injections in my arm/hand and leg. The shots have helped my foot slightly but I feel that they have made two of my fingers much more difficult to bend. I want to try the injections a few more times to see if anything improves.\n\nI received a total of 155 units of Botox. I guess the Doctor had prepared 200 units so 45 were thrown away. I have insurance but prior to a year ago when I started going to the doctors to see what was wrong with me I had never used it. I don't know if I have a good insurance plan or not. I am leaning towards not.\n\nJust for the injections (Not the Doctors), the provider charged $2100 ($10.5/unit) and the insurance allowed a price of $2080 ($10.4/unit). That is not much of a price reduction! The doctors charged an additional $640 for their services and I was ultimately billed $300. So these injections have cost me $2400. Now I have a high deductible ($8000) and have recently met the deductible thanks to these injections so I will only have to pay about $800 and I am good for the rest of the year. \n\nMy question is, Are these prices normal? Or do I need to find better insurance? I get these injections at a hospital so I don't know if that plays a part in the high pricing. I am already thinking about my injections for next year which will likely be at a higher dosage. Do I really want to pay $3000 - $4000 for injections that aren't helping as much as I would hope? I heard about the Botox Savings Plan, but when I looked into it, it only helps people with specific conditions and Hemi-Dystonia is not one of them. \n\nHow much does your provider charge your insurance for Botox and what is your cost?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonia/comments/p1f8sk/what_do_you_pay_for_botox_injections/

It's been the perfect mask- I've been able to return to activities without feeling self-conscious at all. In fact, yesterday I had my first full day at the office since I was diagnosed. Two people commented on me eating suckers- but nobody noticed the wonky head (that I know of).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonia/comments/ofj7um/suckers_lollipops_have_been_my_salvation/

ob26bq,1625074297,very worried,"a few days ago i started to notice that whenever a frustrating or stressful experience or thought entered my brain, my neck would involuntarily jolt to the left. at first i thought it was nothing but then yesterday it started to happen more and sometimes for no reason at all. at first, it was just a small inconvenience but then it started to get very irritating. i remember it happening alot of times in a row and my neck was in a lot of pain. i took an hour long nap and when i woke up, i felt alright but then it just continued to happen. it is currently 3am and ive had some trouble getting to sleep, worrying about this. i decided to do some research and learned that i might have cervical dystonia? i have not been to any doctors or anything like that yet. then i went to see if there was a subreddit for this and there was but looking through it didnt give me much faith. people saying that they were considering suicide as an alternative to living through the pain, and people saying that they’ve given up hope. i wont say my exact age but i am under 18. should i be worried? what should i expect in the future? is there any way to cure this? i’m already struggling with a lot of mental health issues and having another thing like this pile on top of it all does not seem ideal. i would greatly appreciate it if anyone might give me some advice or answers to my previously asked questions.

o2bo2m,1623974604,Another Sinemet/levodopa post; MDS suspects dopa-responsive dystonia,"Background: I'm 32, symptoms came on gradually and suddenly worsened at 29. Dystonia-like symptoms go back to early childhood but weren't diagnosed. Was initially diagnosed with unspecified quadriplegia, then downgraded to spastic hemiplegia, both likely misdiagnoses. The core symptoms are trouble controlling muscles, dramatically reduced speed, and overall rigidity and jerkiness. My right side is disproportionately affected.\n\nAfter an unusually extensive workup and about three years of wondering, my new MDS is suspecting dopa-responsive dystonia. Complex tic disorder and functional neurological disorder haven't been completely ruled out, but they're unlikely explanations for the worst symptoms.\n\nSo, she decided to do a levodopa trial for three months to see how it goes, with a starting dose of 25/100 three times a day after titration. Apparently, dopa-responsive dystonia is *extremely* rare and the timeline makes it seem even less likely to me, which makes me wonder if she's suspecting something worse and doesn't want to scare me. But alas, that's unwarranted speculation.\n\nI have a few questions that weren't answered with searches:\n\n1. The doctor said that it takes three months to get the full effect, although some people, typically with Parkinson's, have a dramatic initial effect. Does this ever happen with dystonia? If I do have a quick response, does that increase the possibility of Parkinson's or is it nothing to worry about?\n\n2. How long does it *usually* take to start getting relief?\n\n3. Does anesthesia affect this condition negatively? I remember reading that some forms of dystonia surface or get worse after surgery and I did have surgery shortly before things got really bad. This isn't important, I'm just curious.\n\n4. If you had a full response to Sinemet, were you able to do everything you were able to do before? I'd like to be able to use a traditional keyboard again, maybe  even do manual labor again, but I'm cautiously optimistic.\n\nThanks for any help you can give!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonia/comments/o2bo2m/another_sinemetlevodopa_post_mds_suspects/

mlx95r,1617782602,Any Germans here? Suche nach einer Fachklinik (Looking for a specialized hospital),"Hallo ihr Lieben, \n\nich wollte mal fragen, ob ihr eine Spezialklinik/Rehaklinik/Kurklinik kennt, die sich gut mit Dystonie (u. am besten zusätzlich chronischer Migräne) auskennt. \n\nMir geht es gesundheitlich sehr schlecht und meine mich behandelnde Neurologin am Uniklinikum kann mir ""nur"" alle 6 Wochen einen Termin anbieten. Ich brauche derzeit aber definitiv eine umfassendere medizinische Betreuung und auch Behandlung, um diesen Dystonie-Migräne Kreislauf zu durchbrechen.\n\nIch bin 27 und stehe deswegen kurz vor einem Pflegegrad. Ich halte diesen ""6 Wochen und dann mal gucken Status"" bei meiner Neurologin nicht mehr aus, da ich psychisch sehr am Ende und verzweifelt bin und starke Schmerzen habe. Die Dystonie befeuert meine Migräne und andersherum.\n\nMeine Ärztin ist sehr kompetent und nimmt sich auch immer viel Zeit, aber sie arbeitet in 2 Krankenhäusern, da es kaum Fachärzte im Gebiet Bewegungsstörungen gibt. Sie ist selbst für Ärzte kaum zu erreichen (telefonisch).\n\nMeine Dystonie betrifft Kiefer, Rachen und Kehlkopf und ist evtl leicht generalisiert (Arme/Beine). \n\nWäre für Tipps bzgl. einer Fachklinik wirklich sehr sehr dankbar :) \n\nDanke und liebe Grüße :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonia/comments/mlx95r/any_germans_here_suche_nach_einer_fachklinik/

m3jj0h,1615561879,Close friend with fear of disfigured hand. What may help?,"Hi! Recently, a close relative was diagnosed with focal dystonia, I think the ""writers"" version. It involves tremors, sensations, cramps, you know the list. The person made the mistake (imo) and went to see images of how does it look on others. The Internet, of course, provides with pretty much extremes of how a hand would look with acute dystonias. Now, said person has the fear of what it could be. If this thing continues progressively, will it come to that? \n\nSo, if that is a thing or not, my mindset is, what can we do about it? How can we try to resist that? What may work against a potentially disfigured hand? \n\nA neurologist prescribed a dopaminergic medicine. I read posts here of how someone can help easing the mind of someone with dystonia. I will not challenge medical advice, I will not challenge the person struggling a bit with daily activities, I will support excercise and mental relaxation, etc. But what can I do to help against a hand being disfigured?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonia/comments/m3jj0h/close_friend_with_fear_of_disfigured_hand_what/

m29w31,1615413211,The joy of remembering you have dystonia because you forgot to take your medication,"One day this week I forgot to take my medication in the morning and felt off all day, not surprisingly.  I didn't realize the problem until I went to go to bed and saw that I had forgotten to take my morning pill from the pill box.  Today, I got busy and didn't take my afternoon dose on time and now I'm paying for it.\n\nI guess it's good my medication works so well, but it's crazy to have the experience of feeling like I did before I was diagnosed and treated.  I honestly don't know how I managed to stay sane then.  It's frustrating that I need to take medicine 3x a day to feel normal and that it's that same feeling of normalcy that can lead me to forget to take the medicine I need to feel normal.\n\nSometimes if I have symptoms, I'll check my pill box to see if I forgot to take it, and it turns out I didn't so I don't get any extra relief.\n\nI guess I just feel like whining about it today!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonia/comments/m29w31/the_joy_of_remembering_you_have_dystonia_because/
