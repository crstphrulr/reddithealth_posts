I’m 19 years old, i’ve smoked weed daily for about 2 and a half years. i also vaped and had the occasional cigarette but a pack would last me a month and i’ve probably went through less than 10 packs in my entire lifetime. To make a long story short, i’ve been spitting up phlegm since October of 2021, there’s a cough but only when i smoke. I do feel like i have shortness of breath but nothing debilitating. all of this is accompanied with back pain, fatigue and a slight tightness in my chest but only when i’m daily smoking . when i don’t smoke, i still have the urge to clear phlegm out of my throat but all the other symptoms usually subside. Could this be COPD? i went to the ER back in January of this year and my X-ray showed some lung inflammation but that’s all the doctor really told me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/COPD/comments/udwkmd/help/

u6jqhk,1650305985,At a lost - COPD/EMPHYSEMA,"Hi. Just wanted an opinion and all of this is self inflicted. Nicotine is a horrible addiction. I have been getting CT scans done yearly to monitor lung nodules for the past 3 years. Last year, my results were stable lung nodules but along with that ""pulmonary hyperinflation"". I ignored the hyperinflation as my fam doc didn't mention it. I thought that maybe it was just due to some sort of cold or something. As long as my nodules were stable then no reason to worry especially if my doc didn't mention this. This year my CT scan results had noted ""mild biapical pulmonary scar"" and ""subtle emphysema"". Lung nodules are still grossly stable. My doc called with the results but once again did not mention any changes in the lung nodules. He also did not mention the subtle (I know subtle means ""very fine"") emphysema. Nor has he mentioned COPD. Isn't emphysema a form of COPD or I guess COPD can turn into emphysema? I am just confused about what is going on as I thought emphysema was a later stage of  COPD. I smoke a pack and a half of cigs per day and have been smoking for 30 years now. I told my doc before this CT scan that my breathing has gotten to the point of tightness in my chest and my heart feels like it is going to pound right outta my chest. He did do an EKG the day of my complaints and that showed no problems with my heart. This year's CT scan was done with contrast vs without. Is this why emphysema was mentioned under the impression? But it isn't in the stage where I may need treatment? Or is it so subtle that it isn't really there? I dunno, I know I am rambling but I am just really confused as I feel like my doc has just dismissed my welfare even if my breathing problems were self inflicted.",https://www.reddit.com/r/COPD/comments/u6jqhk/at_a_lost_copdemphysema/

How is this possible when at the doctor I blew a 2.86? But at home I barely blow 2.48 mainly 2.00 for fev1? That would make me have copd..

But I lived at home and couldn’t smoke in the balcony since my parents didn’t know so I smoked in my room and bathroom. The bathroom has ventilation but I don’t know how well it works, when I smoked in my room I always had the window open for at least 30 minutes after every time I smoked. I smoked everything from half a pack to 1 pack a day. I’m 27 now and I wonder what risk I’ve put myself in, I mostly wonder about the smoking indoor if that have any difference and what that could be. I’ve read about copd and als being caused by cigarette, als it thought to be because of oxidative stress so I wonder if I’ve increased my risks because of the smoking indoors or if it’s the same as smoking outdoor since I’m the one smoking. Would it make a big difference, marginally or no difference since I’m getting the first hand smoke?",https://www.reddit.com/r/COPD/comments/t9cf13/toxins_from_smoking/

t6v9t6,1646434544,Family history and maybe developing COPD,"So I have a family history of COPD, mostly from heavy smoking, not sure if it runs in the family as no one else has/had it besides my great grandma(who has past due to COPD complications) and my grandma who is currently in stage lll who refuses to do any kind of treatment and smokes still. While it’s not for sure if it runs in the family, Medical professionals I’ve talked to have said that it’s possible that it does considering that more than two people so closely related have developed it, but I’m not convinced, so I don’t personally believe it does.\n\nI’ve always had breathing problems ever since I was a kid, but in the last two months I’ve started having pretty serious breathing problems. I’m a smoker and have been since I was 15 and off and on until I was 18 and I’m 21 now and since then I’ve been a pretty somewhat heavy, daily smoker, but I also have asthma. I’ve developed a pretty bad cough with phlegm that’s sometimes yellow, I’m almost always experiencing shortness of breath with constant wheezing, in my sleep I’m wheezing and gasping for breath and wake up gasping for breath and coughing, long walks leave me breathless and I can’t seem to catch my breath for long periods of time, walking up stairs or hills are my enemy because it makes me breathless and often times leaves me gasping for breath with a mouth full of salvia and mucus, a raw throat, and lungs of fire. I also experience a lot of chest pressure.\n\nThe one thing that makes me believe this could be just asthma is that when they check my oxygen levels when I go to the doctors(just made an appointment for this), my levels are fine, but my inhaler never works and I’m often left to suffer with not being able to breath.\n\nI’m not looking for a diagnosis, I’m just looking for a place to talk about this where maybe someone can tell me maybe if this sounds like COPD or not because when I try to talk to my grandma or mom they shut me down and tell me that I’m thinking of the worst and that COPD doesn’t run in the family so there’s no way I could develop it unless I smoke for like, 40 years which is very uneducated of them. I’m not convinced I have COPD and I know it’s very unlikely, but with my symptoms getting worse and worse every day, I’m considering all options especially since I experienced first hand what COPD is like and with how it’s going for me, it’s starting to seem like an option.",https://www.reddit.com/r/COPD/comments/t6v9t6/family_history_and_maybe_developing_copd/

I disagree and see what may be postcovid scaring.  I suggest he use the breztri and if improves no antiboitics.  If the breztri is not helpful after 2-3 days, I would add a zpak and continue the breztri ""\n\n___________________________________\n\nMy research indicates that Breztri is a COPD medication and that is its only approved use.  I did use it as instructed, along with a spirometer that was provided and a chart to record my lung volume.   I noticed marked improvement the first 2-3 days of use in my lung volume, but once that leveled off there has been no further change.\n\nI followed-up on this with the pulmonologist and let him know that my Volume is consistently between 600-700 on the Peak Flow Meter before any Breztri use.   After administering the Breztri there has been no real change, but I do notice an increase in blood pressure. \n\nHis response is that I should continue to use the breztri as prescribed and follow back up in 6-8 weeks. \n\nDoes this seem like normal behavior??? \n\nBy all accounts from the PFT, there was No COPD found.  And when we reviewed the PFT in office, he mentioned that there was no sign of asthma on the PFT as they would look for an increase in volume of 12 points/percent after having administered the albuterol/nebulizer treatment halfway through the PFT. \n\nHe did mention that asthma can be sneaky and may not always show up on a PFT.   However, I am a bit nervous that I'm being treated with COPD medication that is not cleared for any other use and self-doubt has me concerned that perhaps he does believe that I have COPD and is testing this theory through the use of this medication. \n\nAt any rate, the change in Peak Flow has stopped.  For the last two days I have not administered any Breztri and there's been no reduction in Peak Flow.  \n\nLooking for any advice you all may have here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/COPD/comments/t0cwls/looking_for_advice/

After the discharge, sildenafil was restarted and within few days, his resting SpO2 is now at around 82-85.\n\nRespirometer results are similar if not better now.\n\nI searched this online and found some papers having similar conclusions : [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19875684/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19875684/), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4904720/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4904720/)\n\nIs my observation of my father having lower SpO2 because of sildenafil just a placebo?\n\nThanks for any answers!",https://www.reddit.com/r/COPD/comments/sxptch/sildenafil_for_severe_copd_patients/

stmdbl,1644984068,"COPD symptoms? 22 years old, symptoms for 4 years","For background, I’ve only ever vaped for a month or so 4 years ago and in the same time period, I’ve taken a hit once from a pipe that made it feel as if my lungs and throat were on fire. Since then I believe is when symptoms began and it’s been affecting me to this day.\n\nSymptoms I have are: \n- A constant urge to clear my throat that usually is worse in the morning. Rather than a cough it’s more an intentional throat clearing as it feels like there is always some mucus stuck right above the middle of my collarbones in my air tube. Sometimes it won’t bother me much more the rest of the day like at night if I productively expel the mucus early on but there is still occasional throat clearing. This also sometimes affects the way my voice sounds.\n\n- Unsure if this is related but waking up with more boogers and sometimes feeling mucus go down my throat. I also find my nose to generally be kind of clogged but not sure if that’s related either. I’ve read up a bit on post nasal drip but uncertain of whether this is it.\n\n- I have found on certain days that my chest feels a bit tighter and my stamina is decreased when I exercise. It is also harder to sing on those days. However I still feel fine generally on a day to day. I try to stay active and am fine casually running (a few miles) and playing sports. \n\n- Recently, since about a week ago I’ve begun feeling the need to take deeper breaths, as if I don’t feel like there’s enough air. Upon taking a deeper breath, I feel a lot of relief. I never had this problem before and am still able to exercise fine while this happens but it’s something that constantly occurs now. \n\n- Uncertain whether this is related to my not being as fit as before but it takes a lot longer for my heart rate to go back down after exercise comparatively. I haven’t always tracked it but just something I’ve noticed recently. \n\nOverall I don’t believe it has gotten much worse over the years but am unsure as I might not be noticing it. I’ve also taken a PFT test a year and a half ago, and the doctor said the results looked fine. I haven’t followed up since but these symptoms are still persisting. I know Reddit isn’t a great place to get medical advice, but I’ve been really anxious and stressed about this so any input is appreciated from this community.

Everything online says increased hospitalizations and lung infections at the end - he hasn’t had any of that. I think some of it is because he wears a mask and rarely ever goes out because of covid.

Her kidneys are also shrinking, so we have a screening next month for that too. \n\n* Is anyone familiar with diagnosis? \n* What are things that need to be watched out for? \n* I'm planning on having my wedding in NYC, is she going to be okay in the city due to pollution?\n* Hate to ask this, but what is the prognosis or life expectancy after the actual diagnosis? \n* How will this be treated? Currently she is limited on medications because we have no idea what the update on her kidneys are yet. \n* It's a progressive disease, is it possible for it to be slowed down? \n* Is there anything else I should know about? any tips, recommendations?",https://www.reddit.com/r/COPD/comments/s8krlb/mum_was_diagnosed_with_moderate_centrilobular/

Since the start of the pandemic he has worked from home, but eventually he was laid off because they needed someone to actually be in the office after some time and he could only do so much from home. Though my Dad was saddened to leave the company, I could tell he was relieved. My Mom is an essential health worker and it’s taken a toll on her, everyday she is worried that she might bring something home to him. My siblings and I have gone as far as keeping our kids homeschooled and limiting their activities to outdoor sports only. We avoid shopping and eating out, and resort to using online grocery deliveries and shopping. We do lots of bike rides and walks outdoors and literally we just avoid crowds all together. You guys, we don’t mind all the extra steps, it is my Dad, after all, who this is all for, but it’s the fear of him dying that I can’t handle. It’s a shadow that looms over me each day, the what if today is the day someone somehow gets COVID and we pass it into my Dad? I’m so scared he’s not going to make it. He is vaccinated, we all are, but I feel so uncertain these days. I’m going to outright ask this - does COVID for someone with stage 3 COPD equate to death?

Also worked at a poorly ventilated cafe that often burnt sandwiches for 3 years and created a ton of smoke in the room 2016-2019. No childhood asthma or infections. No surgeries ever except wisdom teeth. **History below;**\n\n1. First had very minor bronchitis in late 2019, treated with antibiotics and a Rescue inhaler, no real SOB but I had audible wheezing. **Recovery in 2 weeks**, totally fine as far as the bronchitis symptoms but wheezing hung about at times and I would cough up tiny perfect balls of yellowish mucous. Chalked it to ""allergies"" though I did also have VERY mild swelling in left ankle which no Dr. seemed concerned about but will not it has never gone away. \n2. Second hit of ""Bronchitis"" March 2020, test negative for Covid but have Dyspnea where I can't sleep or lay down and coughing up tiny perfect balls of mucous again. Mild cough but the worst symptom I can't breathe. I go to the ER this time not urgent care because it's the start of Covid and they have the outdoor tents etc. Early days. Chest x-ray is fine, oxygen and vitals fine. They give me antibiotics, rescue inhaler and this time they add short course Steroids. **Recovery 2 weeks,** totally fine, minimal wheezing and I don't touch my inhaler afterwards. Goes in a draw and I forget about it! It expired in the draw. \n3. December 2021 - I have had ZERO ""flare ups"" or episodes of whatever this is since the March 2020 episode. I exercise just fine, occasional wheezing sounds and a teeny tiny bit short of breath sporadically when I begin walking but goes away very quickly as I settle in to my regular hikes and walks, this mildly happens at random over the 1.5 years or so, each time I start exercise but I think nothing of it, maybe just allergies or pollution? The only other symptom is dull squeezing chest pain that makes me tired and lasts around 20 minutes at random and only very occasionally (once a month or less) that I thought was part of reflux from drinking or overeating...Maybe it's not? **Alas;**  I Feel mildly unwell early December 2021 after a period of drinking around Halloween + Thanksgiving but I'm double vaxed with no signs of Covid, I don't get tested because there aren't any available and it quickly turns and presents as my usual Bronchitis symptoms *this time* with SOB that was very worrying so after 4 days I go to urgent care. They give me Antibiotics, 5 days steroids and a rescue inhaler. I complete the antibiotics at home and blew through 50% of my 200 puff metered albuterol sulphate and coughed like crazy with a TON of extra thick mucous, no more balls, this time it was a lot and darker. I started the steroids a couple days after my antibiotics. I was trying to live without the oral steroids but I ended up getting the worst Dyspnea I have ever experienced and I'm leaning too hard on the Rescue Inhaler so I take them and it subsides but still coughing. I finish the 4 days oral 40mg steroids and come off them. \n4. I then continue to have SOB for 4 days after the steroids end (early Jan 2022) but I am now couch ridden, can't lay down, I can barely get dressed but thinking it's just an adjustment period post steroids but then the severe dyspnea sets in **again** with 2 nights of zero sleep and still leaning on the rescue inhaler which is now almost empty (in less that 4 weeks, that's not normal) one particular night I spent on my hands and knees on the livingroom floor and the whole following day thinking I was about to die. So I have to go back to Urgent Care where they run a **heart test** EKG comes back fine except for high heart rate of 125. They also do an **echocardiogram** and all is well, nothing bad found. My oxygen on a walk test was 96 and a little over saturated but nothing to worry about so they order a CT scan for the next day. I leave Urgent Care, them having put me on longer 10 day tapered steroids which I am half-ish way through now (01/14/22) plus a new rescue inhaler AND a new steroid inhaler FLOVENT 2x a day. I have **not** used my rescue inhaler with this round of oral steroids, thankfully have not felt the need for it. Cough has subsided, mucous reduced. I can sleep. \n5. **CT** scan (with contrast dye) results arrive Wednesday 13th and Dr tells me they happily rule out Pulmonary Embolism but they found;  ***Mild Mosaic pattern of the lung parenchyma on the right middle lobe, suggestive for air trapping secondary to small airway disease.*** \n\nI'm doing ok on these steroids, but I am **SO** scared of where I might be after they run out in a few days and I can't get in to see a pulmonologist until Feb/March, if one of them ends up taking me, to figure out what the hell this is - I fear I'll be wheeling myself into the ER next week some time if that dyspnea comes back with the vengeance it had before this 2nd course of steroids and may not even get the chance to see a pulmonologist for a spirometry test or whatever else I would need and find myself straight on a ventilator instead. Plus, I'm a cash patient, I've been rejected by 4 Dr's in the last 2 days. Feeling very helpless and so scared I'll die before I see anyone! I have been trying to not stress or read too much but here I am...\n\nDoes this sound like COPD?...is it late stage?

s1pp26,1641940416,COPD - What it IS and IS NOT. A sufferer’s quick guide.,"Hi all, I’ve been lurking here for a while as a person with COPD/Alpha-1 and I’ve seen so many queries from people regarding whether or not they have COPD or if their symptoms constitute COPD so I’ve decided to come up with a short synopsis from what I can see. \n\nI’ll be speaking from a European perspective, but the broad strokes apply. \n\nThis is my perspective and does not constitute medical advice. My perspective does not take the place of your physician’s advice.\n\n**COPD is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.** It is characterised by 2 major conditions that can exist in isolation or in combination. They are; emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Emphysema is when the walls within the small air sacks (alveoli) in the lungs become damaged and break down due to chronic exposure to a toxic substance (smoke from any source for example). This reduces the amount of surface area your alveoli have and therefore impairs oxygen uptake and CO2 excretion. This is not a fast process, it occurs over years, even decades, not days to months really. Importantly it is a physical/structural diagnosis and can be seen on CT. Bronchitis on the other hand is a clinical diagnosis and is characterised a chronic cough caused by inflammation of the larger airways (left and right main bronchus \[just beyond the trachea/windpipe\]) in the lungs as far down as the bronchioles (the part of the lung just before the alveoli). COPD is characterised by chronic bronchitis, not acute bronchitis which is just another term for a cough/airway inflammation due to a chest infection. Outside of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (see below), COPD is thought to occur in those who have a genetic susceptibility (multiple genes involved / polygenic) to toxins such as smoke exposure.\n\nA point of clarification is that the emphysema component is not considered reversible and it is permanent damage, but bronchitis may be somewhat reversible to some degree with therapies.\n\nA second point of clarification is the terms obstructive pulmonary disease can be confusing as people confuse asthma, bronchiectasis and acute bronchitis with COPD. Obstructive pulmonary disease or obstructive lung disease is an umbrella term for conditions such as COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis, acute or chronic bronchitis etc. They are all different forms of obstructive lung diseases. **Asthma tends to affect younger people without smoke exposure and COPD tends to affect older people who have a significant amount of smoke exposure. You should visit the asthma subreddit for further information.**\n\n**Who typically gets COPD?** Generally, COPD is only considered in those who are over 40 years old and have more than a 20 pack-year smoking history (see further down). If you don’t have these then simple acute bronchitis (This is not COPD) or asthma will be considered.\n\n**What can give me COPD?** Smoking, smoking, smoking. It is the most common toxic exposure (cigarettes, cigars, rollies, cannabis, heroin, crack cocaine – it’s all bad). Be it active or passive smoke exposure or environmental (think smog, smokey cities or open fires). The other risk is through workplace exposure to toxic chemicals and you can talk to your doctor about this as it is more nuanced.\n\n**How much smoking is too much?** Doctors measure smoking in pack-years, it is calculated by dividing the number of cigarettes you smoke per day by 20 and then multiple that number by the number of years smoked i.e. (\[cigs per day\]/20\*\[years smoked\]). Generally, doctors consider 20 pack-years to be significantly heavy smoke exposure to account for COPD i.e. 1 pack of 20 cigs per day for 20 years or 10 cigs per day for 40 years etc. Less is known about other exposures obviously as they are rarer and  less studied but, again, the exposure needs to be chronic. In reality smoke exposure is a spectrum and there is no specific cut-off per se.\n\n**How do I actually get diagnosed?** You need to have **SPIROMETRY (aka Pulmonary Function Tests)** done. A physiologist will measure how much air you can blow out of your lungs in one second (FEV1) and also measure how much air you can blow out of your lungs fully (FVC). The worse you’re COPD, the worse you’re your FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio will be. Think about having to blow through a wide pipe versus a narrow straw as this is essentially what happens as obstruction progresses, the pipes get narrower.\n\n**What is the cut-off for COPD?** Your FEV1/FVC ratio needs to be less than 0.70 to be considered obstructed but this does not differentiate between asthma or COPD (they are both obstructive lung diseases). How to differentiate depends on your response to medications that help open up the airways, called bronchodilators (salbutamol 4 puffs). Asthma reverses after bronchodilators (&gt;12% and 200mL between pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1), **COPD does not**. COPD is further classified into different stages depending on how low your FEV1 is. Mild greater than 80%, Moderate is between 50 and 80%, Severe is between 30 and 50% and Very Severe is less 30%. Importantly you FEV1/FVC ratio must be less than 0.70 for all of these values.\n\nAn important note here is that people with asthma can lose their ability to respond to bronchodilators and this can look like COPD, but it should be obvious on questioning that the person had a long history of asthma prior. More advanced pulmonary function testing can be done called Diffusion and this can help differentiate between asthma and COPD.\n\n**When should I get spirometry done?** At least 6 to 8 weeks after your most recent exacerbations. It should be no surprise that your lung function might be bad while you have a chest infection. You need to wait until your lungs have healed before you do spirometry. You may get a false result of obstructive lung disease if you do it too soon. This just indicates that you have acute bronchitis and does not mean you have COPD necessarily. You need to wait until 6-8 weeks and you’re better.\n\n**Can COPD be diagnosed clinically?** No. All other investigations can only hint towards obstructive lung disease (COPD/Asthma/Bronchitis/Bronchiectasis) such as hyperinflation on a chest x-ray or mild emphysema on a CT thorax. The do not tell you that the airways are chronically obstructed.\n\n**I have vague symptoms such as a chronic cough, I’m always clearing my throat, I’m always brining up mucus. Is this COPD?** No and nobody can tell you on here. COPD is diagnosed by spirometry. Other conditions exist such as post-nasal drip (chronic throat clearing), bronchiectasis (chronic yellow/green mucus production \[usually multiple eggcup volumes per day\] and should be also present on CT) and GORD (chronic cough, heartburn, chronic throat clearing), hiatus hernia (similar to GORD) and these may be the reason for your symptoms.\n\n**I have a bulla, is that considered COPD?** No. A bulla is just a large air pocket in the lung due to breakdown of multiple alveoli. It can almost be considered a single large patch of emphysema. You may not know you even have one. If you have a bulla, get spirometry done and discuss it with your doctor and whether or not it needs to be surgically removed.\n\n**I have been diagnosed with COPD, what other investigations do I need?** Get a **CT Thorax** to assess for the extent of emphysema. Get a **alpha-1 antitrypsin level** done – a low level may indicate that you have a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and this puts you at unique susceptibility to smoke exposure and you can pass it on. Get a **full blood count** done to see if you have raised eosinophils and might benefit from inhaled steroids. Other useful investigations might be **IgE level** that might indicate that you have an asthma/allergic component. If you suffer from recurrent chest infections (&gt;3/year) then ask for **IgG, IgA and IgM levels** as this might indicate you have an immune deficiency**.**\n\n**What treatments will I need?** Your doctor will generally follow the GOLD guidelines. You should look these up. What medications you are on depend on what stage COPD you have, your chest infection frequency and your symptoms. You generally get treated with long acting bronchodilators. You should try to increase your physical activity and muscle strength. If you are very symptomatic then you should ask your doctor about a pulmonary rehabilitation program.\n\n**Are long-term steroids useful?** No, they are not recommended for people who have pure COPD.\n\n**Are long-term antibiotics useful?** Possibly, but generally you need to have 3 or more exacerbations per year to be considered for long-term antibiotics. Long-term antibiotics are not without their own issues but this is a discussion for you and your doctor.\n\n**Vaccinations?** Get them all. Any you can get your hands on (Influenza yearly, pneumococcal and COVID).\n\n**How can I tell if I’m having an exacerbation/worsening of my condition?** Generally, a doctor will look for worsening in at least 2 of 3 of the following symptoms – increased cough, increased phlegm production or a change in phlegm production. Again, there is no point in doing spirometry during an exacerbation as it is obviously going to be temporarily falsely worse and is likely to worry you.\n\n**What will my future hold?** It’s genuinely not understood exactly who will have lung function that declines quickly versus who will lose lung function more slowly. Obvious things that accelerate lung function decline are alpha-1 deficiency, continuing to smoke, the presence of bronchiectasis, recurrent chest infections.\n\n**I am breathless all the time, is it always my lungs?** Not necessarily as the things that cause COPD generally also cause cardiovascular diseases such as chronic heart failure and angina etc. Sometimes the blood vessels in your lungs can get high blood pressure (even if you don’t suffer from the normal kind of high blood pressure). This is called pulmonary hypertension and can be investigated by an echocardiogram or a right heart catheterisation.\n\n**I am breathless and I don't know if it's my heart, my lungs or my overall fitness, how can I tell?** You should consider asking your doctor for referral for a cardiopulmonary exercise test as this can delineate this question more specifically. You will be put on a treadmill and be asked to wear a mask that will measure you're VO2 max. A physiologist/specialist doctor can interpret your results to see what organ was the likely culprit.\n\n**What happens when the drugs don’t work?** When your FEV1 hits approximately less than 50% most people will have increasingly worsening symptoms. At this stage your pulmonary doctor might refer you for lung volume reduction surgeries. This can occur in 2 ways - either they put 1-way valves into the tubes of your lungs so that the parts of the lung that have bad emphysema can be collapsed down so they better parts of your lungs can work more effectively. The other method is a big enough surgery where they go into your chest from the outside through the ribs (thoracotomy) and either remove or collapse the parts of the lung that have the worst emphysema, again, this allows the better parts of the lung to do their job e=more effectively.\n\n**Will I need oxygen?** It depends on a number of things. Generally you will be asked to do a walk test and they assess if your oxygen drops below 85% on walking. If this happens and you are very symptomatic or don’t recover quickly, then you will be given portable oxygen to facilitate exercise. Whether or not you need oxygen at rest is more complicated. You should be referred for assessment when your oxygen levels are at or less than 92% while sitting comfortably at rest. At the assessment they will perform an arterial blood gas and you need to meet certain values to be put on oxygen (PaO2 &lt; 7.3 on its own OR PaO2 &lt; 8 in the presence of heart failure, leg swelling, high red blood cell count or pulmonary hypertension). Occasionally oxygen is given for palliative reasons.\n\n**Is too much oxygen dangerous?** Nobody here can answer that. A general rule is that in the more advanced stages of COPD it is generally recommended that you keep your oxygen levels between 88 and 92%.\n\n**Will I need a transplant?** Again, this is complicated and you WILL NOT get an answer here, you generally need to be assessed by both a transplant medic and surgeon. They will generally consider you for transplant if you have an FEV1 &lt; 30% and  are &lt; 65 years old ideally (though older have been transplant \[parts of lungs even\]), have a relatively normal BMI, mentally prepared for transplant after psychologist assessment, have good social supports. you will be asked to do a cardiopulmonary exercise test to see how likely you are to survive a double lung/single lung/lobe transplant. Your team will weigh up your life expectancy after transplant (anywhere between 1 to 10 years) against what your life expectancy is without it and this can be informed by whether or not you are a slow or rapid lung function decliner.\n\n**I hope this shed some light generally!**\n\n***TLDR: Read the damn post.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResources:\n\n[GOLD COPD Guidelines](https://goldcopd.org/)\n\n[European Respiratory Society Page](https://www.ersnet.org/)\n\n[American Thoracic Society Page](https://www.thoracic.org/)\n\n[Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Resource Page](https://www.earco.org/associations-aatd)",https://www.reddit.com/r/COPD/comments/s1pp26/copd_what_it_is_and_is_not_a_sufferers_quick_guide/

s0yq3i,1641859394,Update regarding my situation,"So, recently I have been posting about frothy mucus and throat clearing. I ended up going to see an ENT but I began to notice that since my ENT visit (in which he found nothing, like literally nothing at all via upper endoscopy) I have had my throat become inflamed/itch(which leads to a cough on my end despite it being controlled/forceful). On the 12th I see my pulmonologist, and if that person finds nothing a GI.

rx24vw,1641431089,COPD at 21 years old possibly?,"Hi, Im 21 years old and have vaped nicotine and flower as well as cigarettes for a few years and cannabis. I was smoking all of these heavily at the age of 16 till now. I remember years ago I would have bad breathing reactions to certain carts and vapes. I had asthma as a child but it disappeared. Anyways, would start to feel a heavy sensation on my left side of my chest at around 18 but thought nothing of it kept vaping, would stop for a couple months from a scare and then continue when symptoms were gone which was very stupid of me. Also have been to the ER multiple times due to peanut allergy. Smoking weed and vaping would make my left side of the chest to feel inflamed and tight, as well as heavy. Now this year is the worst year for me because I was exposed to a lot of sawdust while using an angle grinder in sculpture class without wearing proper protection. After this day my lungs felt so inflamed and a  stinging sensation that caused me to visit the ER three days later. They put me on a nebulizer and some medication and I got better, stupid enough to start vaping. I would begin cackling up mucus like clearing my throat with a lot of mucus from the sawdust incident and vaping. Now I have stopped smoking all together and my doctor said I have asthma, put me on wixella and albuterol. Whenever I get a flare up even 10 puffs of albuterol doesn't work. I now get the random left side chest pains a lot. I also take GERD medication that doesn't help. Now three days days ago I contracted covid, had a fever one day, the next day had a really really bad exacerbation episode that led me to the ER. Left side still stung and hurt. Now its been three days and my lungs feel like how they did from the sawdust, just messed up, heavy. Hard to catch a breath. Lungs feel hard and different, cough feels really crunchy and hard and it clears out mucus, but I'm not really coughing I'm clearing my throat. Nebulizer doesn't really work. I feel bubbling sometimes and can also feel my lung throbbing sometimes. I have the cackling clearing of mucus sometimes as well. I really hope I can heal from this and I regret my smoking history so much. I am an aspiring artist at school and have always been so excited for my future. Im having unbearable amounts of anxiety right now and crying thinking my asthma might be copd. Have a doctor's appointment tomorrow over the phone but just wanted somewhere to type. My mother passed away from lung cancer in 2018, she smoked when she was young, so I already have huge anxiety on that, I dont know why I kept smoking after that I kept thinking, "" vaping and weed isn't bad as long as its not cigs"".

rtyjm3,1641088402,Check-In,"I previously posted about my new diagnosis of stage 1 COPD. 31M. I went to the doctor due to my new inability to run more than 0.25 miles without stopping (due to simply not having enough air). At the time I smoked marijuana flower, and smoked vape oil often. Historically I smoked 10 cigarettes / day for 15 years, and am in descent shape. I was previously always able to run at least a mile without stopping, so having to stop at 0.25 miles was certainly troubling. This was about a month ago when I went to the doctor, and 3 months of decreased lung function. \n\nI stopped smoking everything at the onset of diagnosis. \n\nI had a sneaky suspicion that the THC vape oil was the true culprit. I had previously vaped nicotine, but stopped due to a noticeable difference in how it made my lungs feel. Apparently the THC vape oil treated my chest / lungs differently. \n\nI am happy to say I just ran 1 mile without stopping for the first time in about 3 months. While I am no doctor, being able to run my previous standard is an excellent indicator of my increased lung capacity / efficiency. \n\nI truly believe that vape oil for both nicotine / THC may in fact be worse than typical cigarettes. This is twice I have had noticeable changes in my chest / lungs after chronic use. I never had these physical feelings / symptoms with cigarettes. \n\nHopefully this post can provide some value to many members.

No productive cough at any other time. Had a PFT and CT. Both came back 100% normal. Just curious if I could have triggered chronic bronchitis with the vape. My symptoms are worst during the day and better when sleeping at night. Lying down and resting makes my lungs feel normal.

rokhq6,1640476547,Concerned I have been misdiagnosed... please help,"35 M - I have been diagnosed with allergies and I am concerned there is something else going on with me. My symptoms are constant expiratory wheezing (sometimes more or less) and phlegm in my throat, and I cannot figure out what is triggering it. This wheezing is only when I exhale slowly, if I exhale rapidly and with wide open mouth I dont hear anything. I believe one of my triggers is bad air quality since when it is smoggy out, I tend to wheeze and have phlegm in my throat. Pollen is non-existent right now and today I had a flair-up. Air quality was moderate. Antihistamines do not help with wheezing. Doctors gave me BREO, Symbicort, Ventolin and  those inhalers do not work for me. The ONLY thing that works is SPIRIVA. When I have these random flair-ups and I dont take SPIRIVA this wheezing is persistent and would not go away otherwise. Last summer I had constant wheezing for 3-4 months until I requested to try SPIRIVA. When I take spiriva wheezing disappears in about 3-4 hours and I am good until the next bad air quality day or something that is triggering this flair-up. I dont have any issues inhaling deep or shortness of breath. Dont have any issues running 3-4 miles. Since SPIRIVA is the only thing that is helping me could this be early stage of COPD?

r4j8n2,1638147279,So I'm a Bit Worried About This,"Hi everyone, I don't know if I should about this here in this subreddit. \n\nSo about a week ago (last Wednesday), I went to my doctor to get a physical exam as well as get a tetanus shot (TDAP) since last Monday I scraped my calf on a metal sticking out from the backyard door (threw it away after). Also, prior to this, I was a little sick the prior Friday ( November 12 I believe), and I had a small headache, fatigue, and a sore throat (no coughing, except when it was dry). So anyways, I got the shot, cold went away as well, but the irritated throat stayed with the cough whenever I spoke a lot. \n\nOkay, so everything was going fine, and my worries were going away until two days later, on Friday (November 19). On that day, I started getting a feeling like I was losing my breath and had to take deep breaths because of it. I blamed my irritated throat, and my throat was feeling achy as well. My nose was getting stuffy and I would get a runny nose if I was doing work or workouts. At this point, I thought it was due to the vaccine or I catched Covid (I took both Moderna vaccines during the summer though), but as of right now, the effects from the TDAP should have worn off to my knowledge. \n\nSo as of right now, I still feel like I can't breathe properly and it feels like it got worse ( although I can go run for 3 miles, hiking, and do other tasks just fine). Heck, I even tried singing in the shower to test my breathing and I was doing just fine. Now two days ago, the irritated throat along with the dry cough went away, but I still feel like there's something irritating my airway and my nose gets stuffy, and the phlegm is sticky and green so I hope that's normal. No other symptoms besides those two things. So to summarize, I have no cough (and even when I did, I only coughed once or twice a day), no headaches, dizziness, or fatigue. My chest doesn't feel tight or is burning, but it does feel weird like my lungs are struggling and it hurts randomly at times, mostly on the left side. I also have no wheezing. Only thing there is the sensation that I can't fully breathe and the stuffy nose.\n\nI am a 27 year old Hispanic male who exercises regularly (mostly running). Height is about 5,3"" and I weight about 153 lbs. I do not smoke, drink, or do any drugs, so I do my best to take care of myself, although I have been eating a lot of fast food lately, but I try to mix in some fruits and veggies as well. I have no family history of respiratory problems ( although high blood pressure and possibly thyroid run in my mom's side of the family) and never developed any asthma or other respiratory issues. Although I used to get sick a lot, I haven't gotten sick during the last two years, and the last time I got a nasty cold was Six years ago, when I had a nasty cough that lasted for about a month. \n\nAccording to my doctor, he told me I was in good health and he even checked my lungs with the stethoscope and told me my heart and lungs are in good health and heard no wheezing. He told me that my lungs sound perfect when I breathe so, I don't know if you should take his word for it or something. Anyways, I hope I can get some bit if relief, advice here at least until I can set another appointment tomorrow. Again, not looking for a diagnosis, but just want to be sure if everything adds up to this thing. If you need anymore info, I give more information regarding this weird breathing sensation.

qrz8so,1636677450,It’s probably not COPD,"But the reason I’m on this sub is my doctor said it’s either copd or asthma and I don’t respond to ventolin. \n\nA week ago I did a spirometry test as part of a job application. \n\nFEV1 came back 67% of expected. Employer said I need to see dr. So I think I’m not getting that job. Dr referred me to specialist which is likely to take a long time. \n\nSo, history: childhood asthma, exercise induced, never properly diagnosed by a medical professional. Treated with ventolin. From memory that helped a lot. Was exposed to smoking from a young age though never smoked myself.\n\nThe asthma settled down as soon as I moved out of home and would only flair up if I ever visited family, I used to sleep outside. By asthma I mean symptoms such as SOB, tightness, wheeze and this hell nasty dry cough that was just one long cough until no breath in lungs. And it was something that would happen spontaneously. \n\nAs an adult, fit, worked in dusty environments, no symptoms. Applied for job in early 20s and spirometry came back poor. Didn’t think anything of it as I still got the job and figured I was just aerobically unfit (I know better now).\n\nDeveloped a dry cough in my mid twenties, didn’t think anything of it as it would come and go, figured it was normal. \n\n2 months ago I caught the worst flu of my life which led to secondary chest infection. Second round of antibiotics fixed it. \n\nAbout a month ago saw dr about cough on a whim, started treatment for GERD. It helps. Still a small amount of mucus I think from chest infection\n\nLived my life normally until this latest spiro result at mid 30s.

qlurqy,1635947045,Chronic cough that won't go away,"I doubt anyone here can help me but I honestly don't know what else to do. I've had a chronic, dry, unproductive, cough since March and I'm not getting anywhere with my doctors. In addition to just coughing all the time I sing, laugh too hard, take a shower or even cry without coughing fits that leave me gagging and gasping for air. Initially they tested me for Covid and it was negative. Then my primary care doctor thought it was seasonal allergies and tried a couple of new different allergy medications (I'd been on Zyrtec for years). When that didn't work he started trying inhalers because I had asthma as a kid (I'm 29 now). I tried Brio, Symbicort, Advair, and Flovent. Flovent helped somewhat at least, I wasn't collapsing on my bathroom floor every time I took a shower anymore, but nothing got rid of it.\n\n\nAfter trying all that I was sent to get a pulmonologist and had a pulmonary function test and a chest x-ray. I was told both came back normal but my copy of the PFT says COPD as a diagnosis. The best I got from the pulmonologist was that my lungs do struggle to get a full deep breath of air but that's because of my weight and wouldn't explain why this started up in March, considering I haven't had any changes in my weight. He felt really bad but he just didn't have any answers or guidance for where I should go next. Just that my lungs are relatively fine so there's nothing he can do. My weight, and why I can't seem to lose it, is a whole nother long complicated story but suffice to say I work out 6 days a week and eat better than any patient my other 4 doctors I've seen about my weight have seen so I really don't think that's it, and neither did my pulmonologist, he was just obligated to mention that. Like I said, I doubt I'll find answers or any kind of direction here but it's worth a shot.\n\n\nHere are my PFT results in case anyone wants to see them: http://imgur.com/a/Xhh0YlV",https://www.reddit.com/r/COPD/comments/qlurqy/chronic_cough_that_wont_go_away/

ql10av,1635847830,I've been worrying lately that I might have copd please help,"I am 26 and male in need of some relief so I can sleep tonight.\n\nBoth nan and pop had emphysema later in life, pop was 72 when he died from emphysema and lung cancer, nan was younger when she had it  she died at 58 I'm not sure if it was her primary cause of death.\n\nAbout 5 maybe 6 years ago, I had a random spirometer test and the doctor simply said it's low, nothing else, he didn't order more tests, didn't explain nothing. \n\nWell a few years ago maybe 4 I was in a mental hospital and had observations done, my oxygen was about 95% but dipped to 94% I was really worried but the nurse said it's not that bad, she told me to take a few deep breaths and my oxygen went back to 96%\n\nI have been smoking since about 14-15 so 11 or 12 years, and I've always smoked pretty heavy.\n\nI have quit smoking recently and honestly my breathing feels pretty good, I can exercise yesterday I did 45 mins worth of walking moderate pace and worked up a little sweat, I wasn't huffing and puffing and it didn't take long to return to pre exercise state, good sign? I hope so.\n\nI have had obs done plenty of times since then but I never look at the screen I don't know why just thought I had nothing to worry about, none of the nurses have mentioned to me about anything being off.\n\nWould my obs be recorded when I have a health check at doctors or is that only in hospital?\n\nI just need some kind of relief guys I've been stressing about this the last couple of days, I think quitting smoking has made me realise how much I hope my lungs are normal. \n\nBtw if I do have copd, how long can I live with it?

qdetxc,1634901899,Medication,"So I finally saw my pulmonologist.  You all helped me from having a mental breakdown so much when I was first diagnosed that I thought I'd come back and ask about inhalers.\n\nA little background:  My COPD was found on accident when I was hospitalized for severe anemia.  I did have major shortness of breath, but it was because of my low platelet count.  They still did a CT of my lungs when I first got to the ER, so that's how I wound up with a Pulmonologist and being tested for COPD.\n\nI thought I'd be in the early stages but it seems I'm in the severe category.  Looking back I probably did have symptoms when I smoked, but now that I don't smoke I don't really feel to much shortness of breath or anything like that.  I run 2 miles a day and don't get out of breath, so I was really shocked that I wasn't a mild case.\n\nSo anyway, the doctor gave me an emergency inhaler.  I did have one problem after I got out of the hospital while I was hiking in the mountains on a very steep incline.  Everyone was huffing and puffing but I had to ask them to actually stop while I caught my breath.  He said the emergency inhaler is for times like that.\n\nThen he said he could give me an inhaler (spirva respimat) to use daily.  He gave me a sample to take home to see if it made a difference because during the testing it seemed to help me a great deal.\n\nSo I've been using it for the last couple of days and it might make a small difference.  If I wasn't really paying attention I don't know if I'd realize I was taking it, but there are certain situations where I think it makes breathing easier.\n\nMy question is to take or not to take?  I'm very lucky and my insurance covers it 100%, but then I'm always leery of taking medicine that isn't a total necessity.  My doc assured me that it wouldn't make my lungs weaker or anything like that.\n\nWhat are your experiences with an inhaler like that and is it good to use if it just makes a tiny difference?",https://www.reddit.com/r/COPD/comments/qdetxc/medication/
